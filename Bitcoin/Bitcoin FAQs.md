### 1. What is it?

Bitcoin is a non-aligned digital currency, which is not tied to any financial institution. The currency is not physical and is stored in a public ledger on the Cloud. A public ‘key,’ serving the role similar to a bank account number, is the address through which bitcoin transactions are made.

### 2. Why was it created?

The system was created to produce a currency that is transferable to another person without the need of a third party and with very low transaction fees.

### 3. Why use bitcoin?

The transfers are faster and without high processing fees. It isn’t inflationary since there is a cap on the supply of bitcoins (21 million), which limits how much the currency can devalue through inflation. Apart from international money transfer, it can also be used for investment purposes.

### 4. Who created it?

The digital payment system was created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, who left the project in 2010. He hasn’t revealed much about himself, and his anonymity has often raised concerns over the open-source nature of bitcoin.

### 5. Is it legal?

Its legality depends on what you are doing with it, who you are and where you live. Countries that have legally accepted bitcoin are U.S., Australia, Canada and the European Union. They are also regulating it to avoid misuse such as buying and selling of illegal goods. Meanwhile, Iceland, Ecuador and Bolivia have completely banned it.

### 6. How can you purchase?

Bitcoins can be bought from online exchanges using credit cards or dollars, euros and other currencies or directly from individuals via marketplaces. One can accept them as payment for goods or services.

### 7. How bitcoin mining works

The currency isn’t physically formed at all. Instead, bitcoins are mined through a process of transaction verification and solving a computational puzzle. The ‘miner’ – special user authorized to verify and secure the transactions – who solves the puzzle first gets the opportunity to claim bitcoins as reward, which also becomes the newly released currency.

### 8. How to store?

Bitcoins can be stored either on your desktop, mobile, web or hardware using a software called Bitcoin Wallet.

### 9. How to sell?

You can sell bitcoin digitally either by exchanging it for another currency or making use of bitcoin trading marketplaces, also known as peer-to-peer trading space, where you post a request online and wait for a response. It can also be sold in person, by scanning a QR code on the other person’s phone.

### 10. Which companies accept it?

Bitcoin is the most well-known digital currency, and several companies accept it as legitimate payment in some parts of the world for various products and services. Some of them are Microsoft, Dell, WordPress.com, Bloomberg.com, Reddit, Expedia.com and Whole Foods.

### 11. Pizza, first thing purchased with bitcoin

The first bitcoin transaction was made for pizzas worth $25, for which 10,000 bitcoins were spent. The pizzas were bought by Laszlo Hanyecz in May 2010.

### 12. Transactions are not anonymous

All the transactions are stored permanently on the network and the balance/transaction details of any Bitcoin address are public. However, the identity of the user isn’t disclosed.

### 13. Payments are irreversible

Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed; they can only be refunded by the person receiving the funds.

### 14. Lose a wallet, lose your bitcoins

Bitcoins have unique keys with them and in case they are lost with the wallet, they are removed from circulation forever.

### 15. FBI owns the single largest Bitcoin wallet

After FBI shut down the Silk Road online drug marketplace in 2013, it reportedly seized all the bitcoins of the owner which were worth $3.6 million at that time. It is estimated that the agency now controls more than 144,000 bitcoins.
