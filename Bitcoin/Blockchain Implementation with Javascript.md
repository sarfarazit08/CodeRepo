# Blockchain Implementation with Javascript

Almost everybody now has heard about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but few people actually know how the technology behind these work. In this tutorial we will create a simple Blockchain in JavaScript to demonstrate how they work internally. The training will include an introduction to Blockchain and to learn how traditional business network work. Then we will move on to tracking ownership with/without blockchain and key business benefits. We will be learning the followings:
