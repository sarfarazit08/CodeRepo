# The Ultimate Texting Guide        

### Introduction

Text messaging has rapidly grown in the past few years. Starting in 2005, text messaging has more than doubled every year and it’s not going to stop any time soon. ZDNet Research stated there will be 2.3 trillion text messages sent by 2010. With those facts, it’s clear that if a man wants to be successful with women, he must understand how to text message. It’s a simple skill, but so many men fail to recognize how crucial it is and they miss opportunities because of that.

A while back I realized this evolution in communication and put a lot of time into maximizing my ability in it. Truth is, I am more of a quiet guy because my voice is bad (hoarse and scratchy) most of the year and I knew text messaging would be my way to overcome that crux. The first step I took was not to meet women, but instead, just get their numbers. I did this through online dating, and quick approaches.

My best “quick approach” went something like this…

I would walk up saying a few words that built rapport (meaning feeling or relating about the same thing) and then in an urgent way I would take off and before leaving say, “Hey, I got to go. Here, put your number in my phone, we’ll keep in touch.” From that I would start building on my texting techniques and strategies. Within a few months of trial and error, I started to see a drastic change in my success with women. Because of my texting abilities, a lot of guys started seeing this increase of women wanting to be with me and I started getting a lot of questions from them about what to text. The more I coached, the more I started to see the big picture of where guys were screwing up and how to exactly be successful at text messaging. And that’s what brought me to writing the first ebook ever written for texting, _The Ultimate Texting Guide_.

Most men that read this eBook will have a paradigm shift and they might finish the ebook saying, “Oh, that’s how you text women to build attraction.” I say this because most men are only texting men and friends and have very little knowledge in texting women they desire.

This means their usual style of texting friends will carry over into texting the women they like and it doesn’t work, because you don’t talk to your friends the same way you talk to a woman. To be successful with women you must be able to flirt and build attraction and sexual tension. One of the most important points to this ebook is to show you and give you the understanding of what it’s like to really create attraction with women.

Before we start into the actual texting part, you need to understand a few important points. First, you need to understand that women are different from men and will respond in different ways. I am going to present to you what works for me and the men that I’ve coached. You should take what you learn and then change things up a bit to match your style. Keep in mind however that staying true and being congruent to a certain way of texting and being gets the most results in the end. Also, women will test you to see if you are the real deal and it’s crucial that you can keep going and not miss a beat.

Women will see that you are in control and eventually they will come around and respond exactly the way you want. I’m not saying to be controlling but that you have to have control over your emotions and don’t buy into her tests.

Now here is the key where most men fail: To be successful with women you must communicate to them at their level… their Emotional Level! Really think about this: Why do men want to be with women?

Why do women want to be with men? What do you really think is the answer? There are a lot of different answers to these questions but the one thing that’s universal is that we all want a feeling. And feeling is what drives our lives; _especially_ women’s lives. Think about it, what do you feel when you are with an attractive woman or are even around one? That’s a feeling that’s triggered from the attractive woman and it pulls you towards her. The most important “feeling” that will get any woman to want you is attraction. Without attraction, a woman can’t “feel” anything for you.

**So What Is Attraction?**

First, the great part about attraction is that **Attraction** is an uncontrollable feeling and it’s a biological **response.** Women don’t logically feel attracted to a man. They have a gut‐level emotional response that creates attraction. Women need to feel attraction in order to desire and fall in love. What do you think is the best way to trigger these emotions? I have found that experiences or thinking of an experience is the best way. Obviously, you can’t physically experience being playful with a woman via text; but you can, however, give her those same feelings that come with playing.

I want you to do something. Take in a deep breath and hold it for a few seconds… then, let it go all the way until you are fully relieved. Do it one more time and notice how you feel. Now, think back to the time when you first rode a big roller coaster. Go through the steps as to how you felt. First, you’ll feel a little anxiety and danger for your life as you step inside the cart and give over your power and control to this ride.

What is the feeling as it takes you up the first hill? The tension in your body is building suspense towards the top. Once at the top, you hold your breath in anticipation. Now what? A complete rush as you plummet to the ground! What happens at the bottom of the hill… a sense of relief, right. How about when the ride is over? It’s now fun and you feel safe because you’re in control again. But you now crave that roller coaster feeling again. Close your eyes and imagine this in your own mind. Breathe in at the top of the hill and out as you go down… feel the relief at the end of your breath and notice how it is taken away again as you zoom up the next hill or loop. This is the natural feeling that comes in wave or rhythm, if you will.

Now what was the difference between that little process you did and actually going on the roller coaster? There’s only a slight difference between actually being there, experiencing the roller coaster, and actually experiencing it in your mind. They both trigger the same emotions.

Think of how reality TV shows are using this model. Reality shows are always simple, easy‐going situations and everything goes just dandy… Not even close! People want the intensity of feeling the ups and downs in the show ‐ we love watching the arguments and then we love watching them settle down and make friends again. Feeling is strongly connected to your breathing. Next time you are with a woman, notice your own breathing when talking to her and your rise and fall in your emotional state. Observe this, as well in the women you interact with. Say something that gets them to hold their breath in anticipation, and then let her feel relieved to exhale and breathe again.

Women are hoping to find guys to give them this emotional roller coaster. What makes riding on a street bike so appealing to a woman?

Put yourself in her place. She is giving up her control to you. She may be a little nervous and reluctant, but the excitement is too intriguing because her life is potentially at risk. The ride is usually fast and somewhat dangerous. She gets that rush of exhilaration. When it’s over, she feels a sense of relief that the danger is over and at the same time feeling an adrenaline rush. As long as it wasn’t too dangerous she will now trust you and feel more comfortable being protected around you. And the best part is now she has a feeling connected to you and that is never going to leave.

Women thrive off emotion or chemical interactions. Stimulate their feelings; take them on an emotional roller coaster and make sure you keep her on her toes. Try to keep it positive, but remember, negative feelings can be good too. Keep it light and fun and then jump into serious stuff and then back to light and fun. Whatever you do, don’t be boring. Boredom is one of greatest fears in life. Why is that?

Because there is no feeling in boredom. Point here is: think about creating some kind of feeling in all of your text messages.

### Section #1**

**Most guys fail at text messaging because…**

+ They come across too nice.

+ They text the full 160 characters while a woman is only texting less than 20.

+ They say too much and are too nice saying it.

+ They try having a conversation via text. Save the whole conversation thing for when you’re in person or at least on the phone.

+ They follow the woman’s flow of conversation and answer all of her questions.

+ They don’t ask them out to do something.

+ They don’t try to get to know the girl

+ They don’t include the woman in their responses. Women are more interested when something involves them. So try to relate things back to her. Implying her involvement in something is a creative way to do that.

+ Their texts aren’t written to be responded too. For example, if a woman writes “Hey, what did you do last night?” and the response she gets is, “Went to the movies.” It leaves her with nothing, no emotion, no fun, just dullness. **Instead,** say something like “Hey, I saw a movie and it got me thinking about you.” She says something like “Oh really, what’s that?” Then say something like “There was this adorable little puppy, that whined like you.”

+ They have long messages that make **too** much sense. Keeping a text logical is boring. Instead, spice it UP!

+ They are **always available** when a woman texts them.

+ They write boring texts. Instead use punctuation, like ALL CAPS, exclamation marks, question marks, etc. Every so often use a smiley face☺. Use descriptive words and adjectives. Match the feeling of the text that fits the emotions involved in what you’re writing. For instance, if I saw a movie, I’m not going to be all excited like “Hey! I just saw a movie!”

+ Texting “Ok” is a waste of a text. If it must be said then follow it with something like “Ok, talk to ya later.”

+ They seek the woman’s approval.

+ They agree to everything she wants and says instead of putting up a challenge.

**How men succeed in the texting game…**

+ They write short, witty, fun text messages that get the girl in an emotional state.

+ They don’t answer questions, but lead the conversation.

+ They don’t seek approval.

+ They are a challenge for the woman.

+ They tell women what they are doing and suggest or imply they come too. They never invite or ask: “Hey I’m going to go out, you got time for some fun?” or “I want to get to know you better so come join me for dinner.”

+ They banter back and forth and leave the interaction on a high note, by either not responding back or talking to them later or by ending it.

+ They have high value and high status so they are busy with their lives and women can pick up on that vibe.

+ They know how to have fun and be social so women don’t get a needy feeling.

+ They lead exciting adventurous lives and women get a feel of that in the text messages.

+ They are interesting, mysterious, and challenging.

+ They end the interaction first either by saying “see ya later” or just dead air, meaning no more responding. They have high value or appear to have high value. Do you think Brad Pitt is going to sit there and text back and forth forever or respond immediately after he gets a text? The point is the busier you are with your life the more important you become. This is a good thing in case you missed it. Your time is valuable and anytime you are with a woman she will then feel valuable.

Men succeed in texting because they are aware of what women respond desirably to and can think about what they’re going to say and be creative about it. Texting is perfect for developing better skills in communicating with women. I say this because women are generally more experienced communicators. So being able to think about what you’re going to say and saying it the right way gives you a great advantage.

### Section #2**

Before you start sending text messages, it’s important to understand why you want women in your life so you can create the right approach. You need to understand the real purpose in texting and the difference between texting and calling. And lastly, you need to get yourself in the right mindset for what kind of guy to be whenever text messaging women.

**Underlying philosophy in relationships**

+ Attraction ‐ she’s your little fling

+ Connection ‐ she’s your best friend

+ Attraction and Connection ‐ she’s your girlfriend Decide what you want and need to work on. If you want a girlfriend, then you must first know how to attract a woman, and then develop a deep level of connection/rapport. Getting to a deeper connection allows a woman to open up and be vulnerable. You will often here a woman say something like “He sees something in me that no one else sees.”

If you want to just find women for a good time, then you must think about creating sexual tension. For a fling relationship, you need to have both connection and sexual tension in the relationship. This is where you bag on her, flirt, tease, and imply things together. This is a seductive game that has to be played a certain way.

**The purpose of text messaging**

“**The purpose of text messaging is to flirt, create a little connection, and get a woman thinking about you.”**

Texting is another great tool to meet up with women and allows you to come across in many different ways. Always aim to get an emotional reaction ‐ such as the possibility of danger, being somewhat kind, challenging her, giving her doubt about you liking her, showing interest, or not showing interest. When you use a combination of these, it will leave her always wondering about you and where she stands. This by itself gets you on her mind. Remember, once a woman knows you and knows what you will do, she will stop thinking about you. Be creative and uncertain so she can not pin you down.

Attraction is a feeling that you need her to feel to get her to desire you. But most importantly that feeling has to be backed up with consistent thought. Meaning, the more you think about someone, the more you want to be with that person. This is the beauty of texting: regardless of the time of day or who she’s with, you can stay in her thoughts and she’ll keep you on her mind. Those consistent thoughts about you are very powerful in driving her to want to see you.

**Text or call?**

Texting just to say “hi” in the middle of the afternoon will give her and you a better feeling for when to call. By no means are you communicating and/or having a long conversation via text. You are simply writing her “notes” to get her feeling good about you and to work yourself into her life. She has many options and so you must at least be on her mind logistically. When you want to meet up with her, especially if it’s the first time, give her a call and talk to her. This alone tells her that you’re a man and not a wuss.

Now, when you do call her, remember to feel and act natural.

Relax and be yourself. Normally guys aren’t themselves around women ‐ they change. This is because beautiful women cause a response in men. If a woman is attractive to us then we want to be pleasing to her and seek her approval. Notice how most men communicate to really good‐looking women. They give the woman all of their attention, are agreeable and their body orients or mirrors the woman’s. Men think that if they are nice and pleasing to her then she will like them. This obviously doesn’t work. Most men treat exceptionally good‐looking women with higher value or status than themselves. This will almost always turn a woman off. A woman cannot feel attraction if you are lower status than her. Status and higher value are social dynamics that let us know and feel comfortable with where we fit into the group or setting.

Not knowing where you belong creates status anxiety, which women don’t respond to very well. So being comfortable with who you are and not seeking approval or trying to fit in, will give you higher status. Let others conform to you. You are the leader of your life.

Have this mindset when talking and texting a woman. Talk like you’re just friends and you don’t need her to be happy. You are the source of your own happiness. Having this presence will be very attractive to women especially the exceptional ones. When you’re talking to her comfortably, it will give her the go ahead that she can relax, feel safe and open up to connect with you. She knows through your texts that you are fun, so she’ll have a better attitude altogether. But do call her at times to meet up and at random to show you are a confident man to create a better transition for when you meet up.

Text messaging is where qualifying and the “game” come into play. Women are great at sending mixed messages, and they respond well when men do it to them. Sending mixed messages will get a woman wondering if you are serious or joking ‐ like texting, “You’re fun!

Especially when you just stand there looking bored and not saying anything.”

Put things in perspective. She is not around you and is most likely in a logical state of mind. You must come across un‐needy. You are busy with your own life and may think about her from time to time.

If you decide to let her know this, then text “Hey, I was just thinking about you.” Usually, that’s all you would say. You don’t miss her. If she replies back then you have a choice to either respond or just talk to her later and leave her hanging. Her text should be the last one sent if you do end up responding.

**When you want to meet up**

Now remember, you are still that interesting, fun, cool guy that she first met and you are so busy with your life and other women that she barely even knows that you are going to ask her out. You have no fear of loss since beauty and women are common. She wants you to tell her when and where to meet her. Never invite or ask her ‐ a man leads. Be confident that she likes you and that it’s her that is ruining her chances with you. It’s all a state of mind.

**Guidelines for texting**

+ **How do I set the right tone?** Keep it short and fun, flirty and funny, charming or seductive. It should be emotional not logical.

Women create emotional connections not logical ones.

+ **How do I keep it fun and simple?** Make them feel like they are missing out by not being with you and don’t always give them information. An easy way to do this is to not answer their questions. Keep your texts as short as possible spicing it up with wit and other emotionally charged words. Like when I give a girl a compliment, I sort of take it away at the same time or challenge them. I’ll text something like “Yeah you’re fun… so far.” or

“You’re actually cute… when you’re not whining.” or in reverse

“Stop whining… even if you are good looking.”

+ **How to get the woman to reply back.** Remember, more and more women are getting used to flirting with text messages and they will get that you are fun and respond back. In some cases a few women have had some bad experiences with texting, so don’t rely on text messaging for all your communication. But the best way to get a reply is to ask a questions or text something that is fun and flirty that has a pull for her to respond. For example, I text a girl about cooking together one night and here’s how it went: “Hey if you don’t cook you can always watch me cook.” Her response back, “Oh whatever, you haven’t seen me in the kitchen yet.” My response, “Uh, I’m not sure if I should be scared or turned on.” Her response, “Both.” I didn’t respond back and then ten minutes later she wrote, “So what time are we cooking tonight?”

+ **How to get passed a woman’s defenses.** Never let her intimidate you. Women test what kind of a man you are and will see if you back down to her. You’re not necessarily backing her down, but standing your ground and being comfortable with who you are and in control. That is the kind of confidence that women love in a man. It’s very important you show this side of you.

+ **What to do if a woman isn’t behaving?** Don’t tolerate her second‐rate behavior. If a woman is acting lame or dumb call her on it or move on to the next girl. Example, “I can see you are still trying to get over your last boyfriend. Good luck with that.” Your time is valuable and you’re not going to let some egotistical girl try to control you or get away with treating you badly.

+ **How to avoid the wrong women in your life.** You deserve the best! Don’t ever settle. Always work on improving yourself and understanding others. It’s never too late to be the man you always wanted to be and have that girl of your dreams. If you want to have quality women in your life, then you must feel at a deep level that you are worthy of them and deserve their love.

Think about the women you are texting and if you like what she’s doing or not. If you like it, keep going. If not, MOVE ON! Your first thoughts and impulses are almost always right.

+ **How do I create closeness and comfort?** Speak to her like you’re already friends. Talk to her as if she’s right there. Most women are natural followers and respond to what you do and say. So you must be comfortable in order for the woman to feel comfortable. You can say almost anything to your friends and not worry about what they think ‐ do the same when it comes to women. Listen to her and ask her questions on what she is talking about ‐ this will relax her.

+ **When to text back?** I get a lot of guys asking me how fast or soon to text back because they aren’t the fastest at writing a text message or they are busy with something or they just want to know how long to wait before responding. I intentionally don’t respond right away. Unless I’m riding on some emotion that is going on between us, I usually wait at least 10 minutes before responding back. This shows a woman that I am busy and she must work for my attention. Anytime you can be a challenge to a woman, it’s a good thing. Also, if she writes something that you don’t want to respond to or she is just being lame or giving attitude, just stop and try again later, the next day or the next week. You control what happens. Give HER the approval. Never seek her approval. You ether need to be on the same level or higher. You can do this by texting something like, “you can even hold my hand” or “you can call me.” Showing approval and qualifying is involved in every relationship ‐ it’s important you are on the right side. This can be very subtle, it just needs to be present. Example: ”Don’t tell me you like to play tennis.” Or “My friends think they know you, where did you grow up at?”

Just remember that you have equal or greater value in the communication and relationship. Remembering this fact will help your communication go smooth and will build attraction and prevent you from getting rejected.

### Section #3**

**How to flirt**

Flirting is one of the most important skills in texting. Below, I’m going to give you everything you need to know about flirting. I’m going to explain the key points, the mindset and a bunch of applicable texts to get moving in the right direction.

**The key points to flirting**

+ **Don’t be nice**. Kindness is good at times, but nice **never** works.

In fact, the word “nice” is the number one word women use when a guy is not right for her, “He was a nice guy, but it wasn’t there.” Since women use the word nice to kindly reject men, then use the word nice when complimenting women. Say,

“You’re nice, you’ll make a good friend” or “It was good to hangout with a nice girl.” A woman will recognize it’s a rejection, and she’ll be thrown off when you use it on her.

+ **Flirting in a way that sets you up for an exciting night.** This is a technique I use on girls I’m already seeing. This is an easy technique: Start a small little bantering session early on in the day around noon. Say some fun things so you get in her mind logistically. Then, end the texts in a way where you leave her hanging. Then when you do call her later on in the evening, you can just continue where you left off.

+ **Creating a spark of interest then leave (dead air)** “You’re cute; I bet you got a lot of hot friends.” if she says something, it can be anything, say “That says a lot about you.”

+ **Implementing all the laws of persuasion (social proof, scarcity, urgency, reciprocation, mystery)** For example: You could use social proof by getting your friends involved by texting, “I was just talking to my friends about you, I learned some crazy stuff”

or “Hey, a group of us are heading to a party, you coming?” You could also use scarcity by texting, “I’m heading up to your city tomorrow for a day, you going to be around?” Or “Sorry it’s just not going to work between us, so I’m taking off next week.” You could create urgency by texting, “We need to talk.” Great way to stay on her mind and it will bug her all day.

+ **Set it up that she is pursuing you,** that she is seducing you.

“You’re naughty, stop trying to seduce me.” Imply that she is naughty. This is a great way to create some sexual tension.

+ **Let her know you’re the man.** So if she says you’re good at something just continue and say, “Thanks, I’m glad you noticed.”

Or “Yea, I’m good at everything I do.” Or you could play it on a more humble side, “Yea I get that a lot.” Just make sure you own it. She is actually testing you to see if you can be confident in yourself, never say, “No I’m not, just luck.” You will lose the second you say this and she will move on.

+ **What do you do if a woman is trying to get something out of you?** If she wants you to do something for her I keep it simple and call her out and say, “You’re just here to use me.” It almost always works if you call a woman out on something she is trying to get away with ‐ especially the good‐looking women. If she asks for something, and you know she’s trying to milk it with her looks, I’ll approach it tactfully and say something like, “I would, but your face isn’t pretty enough to get that from me.” It seems mean, but those kind of women love it because no guy treats them like that and it gives them a challenge.

+ **Role reversals** are great flirting techniques. Like saying, “Just as long as you make enough money to support both of us.” Or “Hey honey how are the kids?” Playhouse and pretending relationships are a girl’s favorite past time. Why not bring a familiar feeling back. It sets a good tone and is a lot of fun.

+ **Twist her words or find double meaning.** This is best done by implying sexual meaning. This is really easy and can be a lot of fun. Here’s an example to demonstrate: A girl I met last night just text me, literally while I was writing this. She was responding to my text in which I said, “Hey! What are you doing right now?”

She says, “Just about to leave my house and go to the gym. What about you?” She sent this right back so she has a good idea I’m by my phone and it wouldn’t be the right time to play off that I’m too busy to reply right back. So I ride off the moment and shoot back, “My house isn’t the gym but nice try” She says back “Ha ha oh man, really? I thought it was…” I say “Yeah maybe next time. I spelled your name wrong but anyway talk to ya later”. Her phone sends her name along with the text; which, by the way, if your phone doesn’t do this, then the first time you write a girl put your name in the text at the bottom. That way she won’t have to ask who’s texting her, which is a real time waster. So back to the text, she replies back with “Ha well you better fix it then, it’s much better the way I spell it…later…” Anytime a girl is saying Ha, or laughing is a sure sign of interest. I was the first to end it and I knew she was going to the gym so I ended it quickly. The whole interaction lasted about 8 minutes. She is the last to say something ‐ so now I can call or text her anytime I want.

Preferably, the next day, but the same evening works too as long as you’re not being needy.

+ **Texting the next day is fine considering the relationship and how needy you are coming across.** Most guys will say wait three days to hide any neediness or flaws in your game. That works, but texting a few times throughout the week works great if you use these techniques because all you’re doing is giving her emotional value. So when texting, just keep in mind it’s like you’re just saying hi. So if you have some fun the night before you can comment on her performance last night, or bust on her for her lack of performance☺. These quick little interactions back and forth, or even just a one liner to get her thinking about you, will help her feel she misses you when you’re gone. I like using, “Hey stop thinking about me.” And that’s it. Never say you miss her even if she tries to get it from you. Just say that she crossed your mind and that she is doing an ok job seducing you, and that she needs to try harder for your attention.

+ **Talk to women in a fun way with no agenda.** This was always hard for me at first because I don’t naturally talk to girls just to talk. I have now learned that having something fun and interesting to talk about, asking questions and keeping it flirty and emotionally charged always keeps me interested in conversations. If you want to be interesting, be interested. Don’t interview her, but be genuinely interested in who she is and what makes her unique.

+ **Build rapport and connection.** Relate about something that you both do or text her something that you both experienced together. Here’s a text conversation with a girl I met dancing and how I created a connection, “Hey Im trying to find a girl that is 5 foot 6 and likes to fall on her face while dancing. You know her?”

Her response, “Ha Ha Ha, thanks for the reminder.” I helped her up after she tripped onto her face and I used that in the text and it worked great. If you can, try to text something that relates to a connection you have in the real world.

+ **Understand communication and make friends with women.**

Just having the ability to comfortably hold a conversation with a woman can give you a good break from flirting to develop rapport. A great book to read about this is _Men Are From Mars and Women Are From Venus._ It gives a great understanding of the communication barrier between men and women.

+ **Things start going bad,** meaning she isn’t replying to your texts. I either call her out or move on. I like to use something like, “What is it about average girls always trying to play hard to get.” or “I guess I am too good for you.” Or even better, just back off. Forget about her for a few days, even weeks, or a month while you move on with your life. Then, you can decide to text again. A lot of times I totally forget about them and I love it when these girls send me texts weeks or even months after the fact.

+ **You got to realize that women must be selective in order to carry out their lives**. Women have many options with men and they can’t have them wasting their time. So you need to slowly but surely weave your life into hers so that you’re like friends or lovers and she can’t wait to see you again.

+ **Value your time** and let women know this by keeping conversations short and setting up that you have to be going or that you’re too busy and you’ll talk to them later.

+ **Never laugh in a text.** That is for women to do. Rarely will I even say “Ha” in a text because it destroys the tension. A smiley face can be fun at times :) When I text a girl, I often use dry humor to create more suspense and mystery. Now I love to laugh and I do it often, but when it comes to texting I find the James Bond method to be the most effective… the slight grin on your face while keeping your composure. Watch the face of Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, especially the part when he says to the one married woman, “Perhaps you’re just out of practice.” (He’s implying that she can still be a player). If you watch that scene you will notice that he doesn’t break his composure and has that sly smile that tells her that he is playing with her. He doesn’t laugh or get uncomfortable and he confidently lets her laugh off the tension. That’s what I mean by the James Bond approach.

+ **Most importantly, keep it fun and flirty** to where the woman doesn’t really have to reply but you know she will be compelled to you because your text is emotionally charged. Something Like

“Wow, I thought I was shallow.” or “I haven’t lost all respect for you… yet.” Or “I’m just better looking than you… but I still think you’re cute.” This playful texting is what women love to read.

**Here’s an example of a flirty text conversation I had today:**

“Hey, I know you’re probably out to dinner with the folks instead of me but how are ya?” Most women enjoy going out to eat with friends or family, so this is an easy first text. Her reply, “Lol I’m actually sick in bed… how was your concert?” I had text her the previous day letting her know she is missing out on some fun. I reply with, “Oh that sucks. You’ll get better soon. Just pretend you’ll get something really special from me when you’re better. Like a cookie.”

This was long, but I knew I was ending it here. She replies back with “Ha ha that does sound really special!!!” This fun energy can carry over and now I have shaped the way we communicate to each other and we are both enjoying it. She ended up texting me the next day for her cookie.

If you noticed I didn’t answer all of her questions, girls naturally want to gather information but I let her know what she needs to know and kept the rest a mystery.

**Three easy ways to flirting**

+ **Bantering ‐** is to speak to or address in a witty and teasing manner. Easy for one‐liners but more effective if a bantering interaction is played out. This is a great way to qualify her to see if she can play around. So saying something like “Hey honey, I’m going to be in late tonight, make sure Jimmy gets his bath.”

Women always played house growing up and this is a great way to slide into that role and have fun. By setting up roles, we can now play them out and have those feelings and attitudes associated with them. Women love this. A lot of women also have a naughty side or guilty pleasure to them, so if you let them play out this role they will find you exciting to be around as they are able to express themselves. Example, “I would go shopping with you but I don’t want you to be tempted to make out with me in the dressing room.” Remember, you’re playing with them, having a good time bringing up even the most childlike emotions.

+ **Arrogant humor ‐** also known as cocky funny. Arrogance is having an attitude of superiority manifested in an overbearing manner or in presumptuous claims or assumptions. Saying “I’m the hottest guy here” is cocky and arrogant. Saying “I’m probably the best looking guy you’ve ever seen so you might want to take a picture” is cocky, but in a humorous way.

Joking around and having a good time is the number one attraction secret. Women always rate humor as the number one thing they look for in a man. Laughter is the best way to share time and create connections with others. People generally laugh for two reasons: because something is done out of the ordinary, or because of nervousness. Your body can’t hold nervousness if you are laughing. So anytime you’re around women, it’s a good idea to do fun things that evoke laughter to help both of you relax. Now on the other hand, if you’re too funny, then you’ll end up being her entertaining, little monkey. And if you’re too cocky you’ll be seen as a prick.

So keep the mix good and use it to spice up conversations.

Arrogant humor is a great way to establish confidence. You see many men these days play out a humble role. This may be in part of religious values, but regardless of your beliefs, being humble is not an attractive quality. It can work at times to show vulnerability. A man must be strong, self confident, and sometimes even a little cocky. Have you ever noticed how cocky men are successful with women? Women are magically drawn to this attitude when it’s spiced up with humor and playfulness. So when texting, say things in an arrogant way that is funny at the same time.

+ **Playful Teasing ‐** this is just what boys do to girls. Think back in your early childhood when you chased girls around the playground pulling their pigtails. This is universal flirting and you see it all around you.

Really, who didn’t like teasing girls when they were young? Keep that same context and grow up just a little bit with it by picking apart what a woman is wearing when you see her, or just busting on her over something she says. For example, if they dyed their hair, kind of squint your eyes as if you’re noticing something wrong with it and say something like, “How do you get your roots so dark?” or “Huh, do you like it?” If a really attractive woman knocks over a drink, say “looks like you owe me a drink… after you clean up your mess.” Treat her like your bratty little sister, and that you could care less what she thinks.

The key is to get her to laugh at herself. It’s great to expose a woman’s insecurities and have her laugh about them. I’ve even said to girls that they are boring and that they had to prove to me that they know how to be fun. Women love attention and a challenge at the same time. So regulate that attention by either not giving them any or just playfully teasing them so they can almost feel like you’re possibly pursuing them. If you do it right, you will always be happy you teased her.

### Section #4**

**Making the first initial text**

This section is packed with proven text messages that you can use to get an idea of what women respond to. Make sure you take and twist the text messages to fit your style. And don’t stop improving on them until you start seeing better results.

What should you text? Refer to experiences you had with the woman in the past or create a new experience by role playing that gets her to be a character. It depends on what you want the context to be.

If you are just saying hi, then use some cocky humor. I usually just say, “Hey dork what’s up”, or “How’s my adorable little brat?”, or “Hey cutie, thinking of me much?” or my personal favorite, a simple “Hey, what up?” Or ask her a question that relates to her or about what you’ve talked about or did in the past. This can be situational. For instance, if you met dancing last night, your first text could be, “Hey you, meet any cool, good‐looking guys last night?” Which, of course, you’re implying is you and it will set the right tone and get the conversation started. Remember, to put your name at the end of your text – you don’t want to waste time. If it’s been a couple of days, you could say “Hey, staying out of trouble lately?” And then go from there.

**Text messages to create attraction**

These are aimed at getting some sort of reaction from women (my favorite is the jaw drop) and to build attraction by creating sexual tension and connection. Mix them up however you like. They work great when plugged in the right place and time. You’ll get better responses if you use things that a woman probably never hears; like calling a classy lady a brat.

**Accusing a woman for being shallow**

+ “You just like me for being ridiculously good looking”

+ “You just want me for my hot body”

+ “Why do you girls always use me for my looks”

+ “I’m not just some prize to be won”

**Surprised to see she actually has good qualities**

+ “Wow, you’re actually fun”

+ “Huh, you’re smart too”

+ “I never knew you had feelings”

**When a woman is trying to seduce you**

+ “Nice try”

+ “I know you can do better than that… I hope”

**To get her thinking about you**

+ “Stop thinking about me so much”

+ “Miss me yet?”

**Disqualifying her or yourself. I also call this creating doubt, which can be very powerful.**

+ “You don’t like \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I don’t think this is going to work out”

Example: “You don’t like ice cream, I don’t think this is going to work out”

+ “You’re just not my type”

+ “I don’t think you can handle me” — This also has a double meaning

+ “You’re just not good enough for me”

+ “You’re just not what I had in mind”

+ “Are you always this difficult?”

+ “Why can’t you be a good little girl”

+ “I’m no good for you”

+ “This isn’t working out… we just fight all the time”

+ “You’re just making it worse”

+ “This isn’t helping your chances with me”

**The gold digger approach**

+ “I didn’t know you were rich… I want a divorce now for half of your money”

+ “Well as long as you make a lot of money, I’m kind of high maintenance.”

**Just being friends and other fun plays on her**

+ “It’s ok, I know you want me”

+ “We’re just friends, even though you want it”

+ “Whatever, you so want me right now”

+ “I don’t want to say that I’m better than you, just on a higher level.”

+ “Okay your right, let’s make‐out now.”

+ “Well I guess if you really want to come you can”

+ “Yeah, I think my friends will like you” instead of “I think you might like my friends” see the difference. You can always change your tone to match the atmosphere, but keep the general qualifying mentality that you are the prize to be won.

+ “You know I don’t normally say this, but you might be the one”

+ “You’re such a dork”

+ “I’m sooo out of your league”

+ “You’re just not my type”

**Making sure she is cool**

+ “If you promise to behave then I’ll do a favor for you” and then when she says okay or something, you say, “oh and I don’t do sexual favors.”

+ “Just be on your best behavior this time”

+ “Just try not to embarrass me”

**Talk about their clothes and outfits**

Girls are always wondering what to wear, so it’s fun to help them out:

+ “Just wear something cute and I’ll see you then”

+ “Call me if you don’t know what to wear.”

+ “Ditch the extensions this time, you looked cuter without them.”

**Ways to tease her**

+ “I think you’re nice, call me sometime.” Calling a woman nice is a compliment you give your neighbor, sister or someone you’re kindly rejecting. She won’t like it if it’s done right.

+ “You’re like my bratty little sister.”

+ “You’re boring. Let’s go out”

+ “You’re boring me, come on, you’re supposed to entertain me”

+ “Don’t worry; I’m sure there’s something fascinating about you”

+ “What’s wrong with you?”

+ “When are you going to take me out?”

+ “I’m not going to wait around forever you know”

+ “You seem like you’d make a nice friend”

+ “You’re decent” or “last night was decent”

+ If she says something even as simple as “call me” instead of saying okay, say, “Don’t tell me what to do”

+ If she is asking something from you say, “You’re so demanding”

+ “You’re not that bad” or when commenting on her cooking say, “it’s not that bad, I’m just surprised you can cook.”

+ “Hey, you look like this one amazing girl in my class…” she responds with “Oh really!” you reply with “Yeah, too bad she wasn’t all that.”

**Talking as though she is in the 3rd person**

+ “Yeah I’m seeing someone right now, you might know her. She’s kind of difficult but has a real sweet side to her”

+ “Yeah I met this really amazing girl last night, hopefully she lives up to the hype” This one is perfect of a really cool girl you just met last night and she asks you if you had fun. Or “I met this really cool girl but she was just so hard to read, I don’t know, you think she likes me?”

**Getting her to come over**

+ “I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to come over”

+ “Come by and say hi”

+ “If you come over you got to promise not to laugh” She will think that your place is a mess or something, which it shouldn’t be…

right?

+ “Hey I’m going to head home, have fun with your friends”

+ “You’re nice, maybe we can hang out sometime”

+ “When are you going to come over and cook for me?”

**Challenging her**

+ “I don’t know if you can keep up”

+ “Can you handle me?” good double meaning

+ “I don’t think this is going to work out, got any hot friends?”

**Role reversals**

+ “You just want to show me off to all your friends”

+ “You’ll probably just brag to all your friends how you got with me”

+ “I’m kind of a big deal, so don’t take it personal if I get all the attention”

+ “What, just because I don’t put out doesn’t mean we can’t be together.”

+ “When are you going to take me out to a nice dinner and buy me things?”

**Being busy is good. It shows you have a life of your own. Women don’t want to be your life – they want to be a part of your life.**

+ “Hey I’m busy, let’s talk later.” Sometimes I will just say “I’m busy” and that’s it, which is fine, but you’re not giving her any options, which doesn’t get anywhere.

+ “Tomorrow is not going to work I got to finish a project.”

**Giving her suggestions on things she should do, like tips to improve her look.**

+ “It’s ok, but you should wear your hair down”. This sets up that she must work for your approval.

+ So if she has blond hair say “It’s nice, I like brunettes” If she says she can dye it then say, “I don’t want you being fake” or “Just wear a hat.” That will get a punch on the arm. She is there to impress you and get you’re attention. Think about it, why do women dress up and look as cute as they can? _To get your attention and impress you._ So put that in the open and have them impress you in other ways.

Remember in all of your text messages to challenge her, flirt, role play, have fun, twist words, crack jokes, put her on the spot, approve, disapprove, qualify, be important, be a mystery, tease and most importantly create some kind of feeling she is going to have when she reads your text. Generally speaking, people always want what they can’t have. So just give her enough hope to keep trying. You can satisfy her from time to time to surprise her, but keep her on her toes. In other words, always keep her guessing and having doubt, with the possibility for excitement.

**Secret text tip, exercise the word “NO”**

The word **NO** is a very attractive word to women, especially if they are good looking. It shows that you are picky, you have an opinion, you are a qualifier and you are in control. If she asks, “Do you want to go do this?” and you don’t want to, just say, “no, do you want to?” Or let’s say she wants to meet up and you can’t, instead of saying “oh I can’t sorry” say, “No, next week will be better.” It’s a very powerful word because the word NO internally triggers a challenge.

Another reason is because women don’t hear that word from men a lot (especially the attractive ones). They almost always hear yes this and yes that or some passive way of saying no. So during your text messaging, try to exercise the word **NO**.

**The four step process to meeting up**

You can text to meet up, but only after you’ve met up once before. Calling her for the first meet up establishes that you are interested in her and sets the tone that you are a man, which is what she wants! You need to be the man and continue to progress and lead the relationship.

**1\. Create Interest**

This is what gets a woman curious about you. If she is curious she will want to know more about you. She will generally ask you questions of interest and engage you in texting back and forth. Do not answer all of her questions, but lead the interaction and keep her interested. Just make sure you have something interesting about you that she feels.

**2\. Create a feeling**

Any emotion a woman feels when dealing with you is always to your advantage. Try to keep those feelings more positive, but negative ones work too. Keep in mind humor is the number one emotion women want to feel.

This is important because if you were to just jump right into “hey, let’s hang out” and you haven’t created a feeling about you then she has no reason to. Her reasoning to meet with you comes from how much she feels when she interacts with you.

Use the text messages above for guidelines on how to create desirable feelings and the texting conversations in the next section to see how I created those emotions.

**3\. Leave her hanging (dead air)**

Creating value and then leaving her hanging is very powerful. She must feel what it’s like when you’re around and then miss those feelings when you’re not around. This is best done after 3‐5 texts. Don’t be texting her all day. Keep it short and fun that gets a feeling and then you’re gone.

**4\. Meet up**

You’re set if you have created interest, a feeling about you and an empty void when you are gone. All you have to do at this point is call her up either that evening or the next day and see what she’s up too. Have a plan for something to do, like “Hey some friends of mine are getting together to watch survivor” or “Hey have you ever seen xyz movie?” or “I got a barbecue going on come join.” If she has plans say, “That’s too bad,” and let her know how she is missing out. Don’t be surprised if a girl you have been texting earlier, texts you that night to see what you’re doing. If you’ve given her that emotional value then she will be thinking of you and she will want to see you. I’ve had many girls call or text me later to see what I was doing, before I was even able to text her about meeting up.

### Section #5**

**Real life text messaging examples**

As you practice and gain more experience dating and meeting women, it will become second nature to flirt, create emotions and be a challenge through text messaging. For instance, one Sunday night I was talking to 8 different women via text. It was a Sunday evening and most women are available to text at this time. Most of those interactions lasted 2‐4 texts from me before I ended it. I will give you one of the longer ones as an example of how to amplify attraction.

**Conversation #1**

This is from a girl I met last night. We had a fun time dancing and joking around. I even protected her from some real creepy guys by leading her around the dance floor so she could find her friends. I was able to really connect and develop attraction with her so I knew that the next day would be fine to text her or even see her. At about one in the afternoon I texted her, to say hi. This is how I did it: Note: Before I got her number and left, I was talking to her about whether or not I thought she was fake.

**Me:** “Hey, Thanks for the fake number. What else is fake about you? ‐Tyler”

_Remember to add your name the first time you text if she doesn’t have your number yet._

**Her:** “Ha ha always with the fake! I can’t believe you don’t think Im sky diving on the weekend! :)”

_She replies a few minutes after mine so I know she is down to talk right now._

**Me:** “I am not saying you don’t have it in you. I just doubt if you got what it takes”

_This is a fun way of challenging her and women love this._

**Her:** “Ha ha is that a challenge?”

_She is laughing, good sign._

**Me:** “Not for me but we’ll see if you’re up to it”

_This is subconsciously telling her that I am a challenge. I actually got another text from her right when I sent this, because I took about 5 min to respond back. This will usually get her to be interested in you._

**Her:** “So what else is fake about you?”

_This is the text she sent while I was about to send my previous text. As you can see, she is asking me a question. She is interested or “buying.”_

**Me:** “You’ll just have to wait and find out for yourself”

_Not answering her question and again getting her more curious and interested._

**Her:** “Are you asking me out on a date?”

_You see women read into things and what I said is indirectly telling her that I want to see her. Women always give indirect signals like what I just said. I’m just trying to speak their language, which creates connection and attraction._

**Me:** “No, but it looks like you just did”

_As we talked about in Section #4 about the power of the word “NO” I plugged in the word “NO” and this word really dials up the attraction._

**Her:** _“_ Ha ha yeah sometimes I can be forward. ;)”

_Notice how she is laughing off the tension and I am not._

**Me:** “Cool, I’ll call you later and let you know when you can take me out

:)”

_This is my first smiley because I usually want her to be wondering if I am joking or not._

I sent this last message more than 10 minutes after her text. We were texting back and forth and then I paused to let the tension build, especially after what she said. Notice how I’m keeping control of the interaction. Now I’m right where I want to be when I give her a call later. (Note: I have set the tone that I am the leader and she is taking the position of a follower. This is fine and most women are ok with that and most of the time they want you to be the leader.) I could let her take me out, but I can tell she really wants me to be the one in the driver’s seat. This is only a test by me to see if she can have fun and go with it. This totally keeps her on her toes.

**Her:** “Ha ha can’t wait!”

At this point I will call her later on to say hi and to let her know that I am busy tonight and I won’t tell her what I’m doing. I will end off saying that we should meet up tomorrow for whatever I got going on.

Now, if she doesn’t answer her phone, just leave a message and say “Hey… it’s Tyler… I’ll talk to ya later.” That’s all I will leave on the message. I will make sure my voice is clear, slow and little lower to give it a manlier tone (all of which women respond well to). Chances are, she will either call me or text me before I call her tomorrow because I have created enough curiosity about who I am and I know she wants to see me.

**Conversation #2**

This is from another girl I met a few nights ago and I ended up going home with later on that night. We just kissed, I promise. When I left her place I was meeting up with some of my family for lunch.

Here’s a quick text conversation to keep building the attraction and to help her feel good about last night.

**Me _:_**  “I was late because of you but it gave me an opportunity to tell my family how I hooked up with a really awesome girl”

_I didn’t even mention this girl to my family._

**Her:** “Ha ha yeah right, I’m sure you told them how you hooked up”

_She is joking, but most women really want to know this kind of information so she can’t help but investigate._

**Me:** “What, I did tell them.”

_Making it more serious to her that I’m cool with it and not embarrassed by her._

**Her _:_**  “You must have a really open family”

_She’s now hooked and now I’m going to take her on a little emotional ride._

**Me:** “Yeah they want to meet you”

_I am really pushing it here and not letting her know that I am joking._

**Her _:_**  “How many siblings do you have?”

_She is preparing herself and not bailing out. This lets me know that she’s really into me, which I already knew from last night. But it reconfirms it to her and builds the relationship._

**Me:** “No you dork. I don’t kiss and tell.”

_Although I just busted on her she is actually relieved of the pressure of meeting my family. I just made up a quick story for her and it put her on a real emotional roller coaster ride, which will instinctively connect her more to me._

**Her:** “Ha ha you suck”

**Me:** “Anyway, I’ll call you when I get back from my trip and let you know how you missed out”

_I was leaving the next day on vacation._

**Her:** “Oh thanks! :)”

**Conversation #3**

This is a conversation with a girl I met recently and she is a super-cute, little blonde and we totally vibe with each other.

**Me:** “I am going swimming in your pool later… I guess you can come too”

_She has mentioned that she has a pool and invited me to come on Saturday night. I had better things to do… like meet gorgeous women._

**Her:** “Oh man I can’t tonight. I have this huge paper due that I haven’t started on. Rain check?”

_I didn’t screen her to see if she was available; not like it really matters though. She counters with the rain check comment._

**Me:** “Oh you slacker. Looks like I’ll be swimming laps without you”

_I’m not letting it get to me that she can’t make it, and I bust on her for procrastinating._

**Her:** “Ha ha you’re just scared I would lap you”

_She is able to come into my world and play!_

**Me:** “No. If anything I’m concerned you won’t be able to handle me”

_Anytime I can say no is a personal favorite. I then challenge her with the double meaning of handle me._

**Her:** “Ha ha I worry the same about you!”

_She is always laughing, which is a sure sign of interest. I’m getting excellent responses, which lets me know she is interested._

**Me:** “Nice, just finish your paper and call me sometime :‐)”

_Complimenting her ability to play and then ending it first._

**Her:** “Only if you think you can keep up :)”

She’s challenging me! Awesome! I could use a challenge. She is a fun girl. This is a great example of how long your texting interactions should be and how they should flow on an emotional level. We banter back and forth and I leave on a high note. This is fun for both of us.

The next time I come in contact with her, it will definitely be fun!

These are some examples of the power that text messaging can have on your relationships. Remember, you’re texting to build attraction, NOT friendship. Give it a shot. With a little practice, you’ll have these techniques down in no time.

**Bonus Section #6**

**Making the phone call**

It will be a lot easier to call her because you’ve already been texting and communicating with her. Calling is also another great way to transition smoothly into the real world and meet.

This is a crucial step in meeting up with a woman. For many men this step can be very difficult. You can get that feeling of anxiety where you are not sure exactly what to say or hope that she is not busy and you get her at a good time. There are thousands of things to worry about. I know, I’ve been there before myself. And now, I don’t think about it. When I get a minute, I will call her and actually tell her I had a minute and wanted to talk to her. It doesn’t really matter what you say as long as you are calm and collected. Don’t let yourself think about it and get all worked up and nervous. Just casually dial the number like you’re calling a friend. You talk casual with a friend on the phone; keep that same vibe and mindset with women.

**5 points to hit when talking to her on the phone** Women love a man that can successfully have a phone conversation. Every time you call and talk to a woman hit all 5 of these points:

**1\. Get her laughing**

Joking around, being playful, teasing her and flirting are the best ways to create attraction and it will make her want to meet with you.

**Here are some ways to joke and flirt with her on the phone…**

+ Talk about something dumb she wrote online and joke about it.

+ Make fun of yourself.

+ Interpret what she is saying in a funny way. If she says something like “I am going to clean my house.”

Interpret it and say, “So you’re having a bad a day?”

+ Ask questions that put her on the spot. If she says something that she is doing say, “What is it about women and… (say whatever she’s doing.)” Make it seem like she has issues that she has to explain her way out of.

+ Relate with her in a fun way. Say something like “Now, were you just saying you loved hiking just to get solid guys to want you” and then talk about where you have hiked and what type of hiker she is and joke around about the different types.

+ Tease her. Say things like “you would”, “that’s kind of creepy”, “I don’t think you are ready for that yet.”

**2\. Slow down and speak clearly**

Talking too fast is a sign of neediness, lack of confidence and a poor presentation of who you are. A slow, clear communicator is always more attractive.

**3\. Keep it short, 5‐10 minutes max**

Conversations that are short build attraction. You’re basically just seeing what’s going on and if there’s a possibility that she gets to meet up with you. If you’re having interesting conversation, just say “I got to get going, let’s continue this later” if she asks where you’re going, just say “it’s a surprise” or “I got some strippers coming over.”

It’s good to build a sense of urgency that you need to get her off the phone because you have something else more important that needs your attention. Telling her you have all the time in the world for her is like saying I am boring and there’s not much to me.

Even say, “Hey I got to get going here in a minute, but I wanted to see what you’re up to.” When done right, it will leave her wanting more, and she will be down to meet up.

**4\. Have a plan**

Never say, “What do you want to do?” This is not the role of a man and most women don’t like to take the position of the decision maker. A real man will confidently take her by the hand and make something happen.

**Things to do…**

+ Go shopping for a trip you’re going on

+ See a movie

+ You’re hungry and are getting something to eat

+ Go out to a bar or social scene

+ There’s an art show or concert

+ You’re having some friends over

**Be creative**: Such as, you ran out of milk and need her to pick you up some and bring it over. Keep in mind, everyday things like going grocery shopping or buying a book work great.

Just remember to **always** present ideas and never say, “Whatever. I don’t care what we do.” If you both can’t come up with something, always jump in and say, “Okay, well, let’s do this and if it doesn’t work or if it’s not fun we’ll go do that.”

If you do make plans, keep in mind the more unavailable you are the more attractive you become. So don’t say “anytime” is good for me. This is an excellent time to set up boundaries by saying “no that doesn’t work for me”. Women eat it up that you have an opinion and a full life.

**5\. Make sure you end the call first** Always end the conversation before you run into talking about each other and your lives, or before an uncomfortable pause happens.

Remember, to be cool, don’t stress it, and bring that fun energy into the phone call that you’ve been having with the text messages.

Be a little busy and like you got a lot on your plate. You can even bring up the same things you were texting her like “so did you get the kids to bed…” It’s fun and simple. Take control of the conversation early on by asking her questions about herself and see when she is available to meet up. Say to her “I’m busy tomorrow so how about we be spontaneous and meet up tonight.” Don’t sit there and talk forever.

Just see when she can meet up and let her know if that works for you or not, and meet up already! Usually, you want to end off with her laughing. Try saying something like, “yeah just try not to embarrass me” or “yeah and don’t forget to paint your toe nails.” or “I hope you’re fun to be with.” or “As long as you look good.”

**Decoding a woman’s text**

It’s important you understand that you are really not decoding a woman’s text, but rather confidently handling the situations and moving the conversation. For the most part, women are responders and men are initiators. Women might test, send you a mixed signal or whatever, but she will change based on the confidence that comes out of you. Your job is to not be affected by her and keep doing your thing.

If she is sending a text message that is iffy and you are not sure what is going on, then Withdraw Your Interest. If a woman says,

“something came up and I can’t make it” I usually don’t respond back because she is not giving me any counter offer. So I withdraw my interest. You can try calling her out and say she’s lame or say she’s going to miss out. But for something like that, I usually just leave it and put nothing.

The most important thing you can do is **move on.** Do the best you can to learn from what happened. Don’t let it get to you. Move on. Women base their decisions on emotion, and right then, she wasn’t feeling it. That’s fine. There are plenty of other girls that will. She missed her chance and will have to make it up to you if she wants to see you again. If she flaked on you try sending, “So how are you going to make up last night to me?”

+ **Understand what she really means**

I don’t bother with this too much because I just assume that she wants to see me and might be a little insecure about it.

The person that cares the least has the most power. So you’re going to live your life and be happy regardless of her. You are merely sharing that with her.

+ **What to say back**

If you don’t know what to say, then don’t say anything at that particular moment. Silence is the best answer. Don’t get emotionally involved in what she is saying; if you act from emotion, then you are reacting instead of responding.

+ **Responding correctly to the hardest texts she will put on you** Either don’t answer and ignore it or try to look at things from a different perspective. The best perspective is where your happiness comes first. So if she says “Do you like me?” say “Well I’m still getting to know you” or “Yes… as a friend” or “Yeah you’re nice”.

Let’s say she asks you a question you don’t want her knowing the answer to, like say you had a date last night and she says, “What did you do last night.” You can either ignore her and talk about something else or just say, “I was talking to all of the dancers at the strip club to see if you were any good for me.” If she says, no really just say, “Yeah and later we all had a huge orgy, you missed out” Don’t give in, she doesn’t really want to know. She’s just acting on curious impulses and testing to see if you will break. You could just say, “Oh I was out with a friend.”

What do you think girls say in these situations? Women are pros at being vague and not telling you things that you might not like.

She knows you will leave if she says, “yeah, I was with this hot guy and we had some casual fun.” Unless you’re exclusive, you don’t need to know all of each other’s business.

**Safety concerns for text messaging**

Texting has an impersonal and unsafe side because you can never be sure who is on the other side. The points below are helpful tips to think about when texting and using your phone:

+ **Don't ever text personal information** such as your PIN number, password, or banking information to anyone. Remember, once you send that information to another person, it gets stored in their cell phone. I’ve heard of a few accounts where a guy/girl stole someone’s phone and text messaged all the people on the phone and got valuable information. Don’t be that person that becomes a victim to this. Never release valuable information.

+ **Putting a password on your phone keeps others from accessing your text logs or email.** This will also prevent thieves from stealing information stored in your phone.

+ **Don't forget to erase all your personal data before selling, recycling or donating your old phone.** Many people are still under the impression that taking out your SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card will do the trick, but that's not entirely true. Most Cingular and T‐mobile phones have SIM cards while some other carriers use a RUIM (Removable User Identity Module). You'll need a series of codes to permanently delete stored information. For this, find out if your phone has a "master reset" feature, which wipes out all the stored data at once. Since every phone has a different set of "master reset" instructions, you'll need to either look them up online or on your phone's manual. Recellular has a database of these codes with step‐by-step instructions. You'll need your phone's make and model to get started. If you don't know it, check the back of the phone or the box.

+ **And last but not least**, ultimately, the security of private text messages depends on the recipient.

Keep these points in mind and you should have no security problems with text messaging.
