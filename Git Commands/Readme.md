Git was initially released on April 7, 2005. It is a version control system to track changes in computer files and to coordinate work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development and can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files available in the English language. It is aimed at speed, data integrity and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. It is free and open source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.

Moreover, Linus Torvalds was the creator of GIT for the development of the Linux kernel. On the other hand, its current maintainer since then is Junio Hamano. Thus, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.
