            <p>The next lecture will be an exercise and there will be more exercises as you progress through the course.</p>

<p>The exercises are difficult and sometimes tricky and I don't expect students to solve them all. Most students actually fail to solve the exercisesunless they are already familiar with Python.</p>



<p>The whole point of exercises is to force you to think about how to solve a problem independently. The next lecture following each exercise contains the solution where you can compare your approach.</p>
