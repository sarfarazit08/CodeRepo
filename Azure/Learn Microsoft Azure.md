## Cloud Fundamentals 

### What's this cloud thing ? 
  + It's not just a buzzword.
  + There is no cloud. It's just a (someone else) computer 
  + Misconception that if something is virtualized then it's cloud. It's not!
  + [Definition of Cloud Computing](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf)
  
#### Essential Charachteristics

+ ___On-demand self-service___: "A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities... ..as needed automatically **without requiring human interaction** with each service provider." 

+ ___Broad network access___: "Capabilities are available over the **network** and accessed through standard mechanisms... " - WebUI, CLI, API, SDK, VPN, Dedicated Lines etc.

+ ___Resource pooling___: "...resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a **multi-tenant model**..."

  "There is a sense of **location independence** in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources..."

e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Office365, Dropbox, Netflix etc.

+ ___Rapid elasticity___: "Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released... ... to **scale rapidly** outward and inward commensurate with demand."

  "To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often **appear to be unlimited**..."

+ ___Measured service___: "Resource usage can be **Monitored, controlled, and reported,** providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service."

### Cloud Deployment Models

| Cloud Flavors | Description |
|-|-|
|Public|Exist on the premis of the vendor for public use. E.g., |
|Private|Exist on the premis of the vendor exclusively for business/private use.|
|Hybrid|Having flavors of both public and private cloud.|
|Community|It's similar to Hybrid cloud in many ways. When a group of organisations club together and make a dedicated cloud plateform specifically for their use - a shared set of requirement(s). E.g., AWS Govt. cloud, Azure Govt. cloud|

+ Public Cloud is **Easy** - lots of examples.
+ Community Cloud is a thing - it exists.
+ Be **skeptical** of claims of Hybrid Cloud.
+ Be **very skeptical** of claims Private Cloud.

### Cloud Service Models : Cloud Service Spectrum

+ Cloud Servies - Products with in the Cloud
  + All cloud product fit somewhere
  + Other Service Models occupy a range somewhere
+ Service Models (\*aas)
  + IaaS : Infrastructure as a service
    + FaaS : Function as a service
    + DaaS : Database as a service
  + PaaS : Plateform as a service
  + SaaS : Software as a service
  + BaaS : Blockchain as a service
+ What the end-user gets
+ What the end-user manages
+ What the end-user sees

As you move from IaaS to PaaS to SaaS you loose flexibility but you gain in terms of ease of management which means less cost and less risk.

## Azure Fundamentals
