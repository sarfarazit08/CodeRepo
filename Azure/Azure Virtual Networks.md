# Azure Virtual Networks

### Module 1 – Planning Virtual Networks

As with on-premises networks, Microsoft Azure networks need to be planned carefully to ensure that they work as expected. However, you should find that your knowledge of planning on-premises networks translates relatively simply into the Microsoft Azure environment. In this module, you will:

+ Learn how virtual networks can be used to support virtual machines and PaaS cloud services.
+ Learn about the features supported by Azure virtual networks.
+ Learn how on-premises computers can connect to VMs in an Azure virtual network.
+ Plan a VPN connection from one Azure virtual network to another.
+ Learn how to design IP address space and subnet allocation.

### Module 2 – Managing and Deploying Virtual Networks

In the second module, you move on from the planning process to review how to create and manage the virtual networks that you create. You will configure virtual networks using both the Microsoft Azure Portal and PowerShell. In this module, you will:

+ Create and configure virtual networks (VNETs) by using the Microsoft Azure Management Portal.
+ Create a virtual machine and deploy that VM into a VNET by using the Microsoft Azure Portal.
+ Create a VNET by using PowerShell with the Azure Resource Manager deployment model
+ Deploy a virtual machine into a VNET by using PowerShell.
+ Learn to navigate the schema of a network configuration file.
+ Export and import network configuration files to configure the virtual networks in an Azure subscription.

### Module 3 – IP Addressing

You can assign IP addresses to Azure resources to communicate with other Azure resources, your on-premises network, and the Internet. In this module, you will:

+ Learn about public and private IP addressing.
+ Assign static IP addresses.
+ Assign public IP addresses.
+ Use multiple NICs in Azure virtual machines.
+ Define rules and plan for network security groups.

### Module 4 – Network Services

Virtual Networks in Azure have a range of features that help you to group virtual machines and cloud services and connect to VNets from on-premises or internet-connected machines. In this module, you will:

+ Learn how to configure Azure DNS.
+ Learn how use to Load Balancer.
+ Learn how to configure Azure Traffic Manager.
+ Learn how to configure Application Gateway.

### Module 5 – Intersite Connectivity

In this fifth module, you will learn how to establish connectivity between two or more sites in Microsoft Azure, as well as how to connect from your on-premises computers to Azure virtual networks. In this module, you will:

+ Learn about the options for inter-site connectivity.
+ Configure a Point-to-Site VPN.
+ Configure site-to-site VPNs.
+ Configure VNet-to-VNet VPNs.
+ Learn how to use ExpressRoute.
+ Understand important considerations when configuring inter-site connectivity.

### Azure Networking Components Overview

A major incentive for adopting cloud solutions such as Azure is to enable information technology (IT) departments to move server resources to the cloud. This can save organizations money, and simplify operations by removing the need to maintain expensive datacenters with uninterruptible power supplies, generators, multiple fail-safes, clustered database servers, and so on. This is particularly advantageous for small and medium-sized companies, which might not have the expertise to maintain their own robust infrastructure.

Once the resources are moved to Azure, they require the same networking functionality as an on-premises deployment, and in specific scenarios require some level of network isolation. Azure networking components offer a range of functionalities and services that can help organizations design and build cloud infrastructure services that meet their requirements.
