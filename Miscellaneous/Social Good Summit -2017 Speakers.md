Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus
------------------------------

### Director-General World Health Organization

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was elected as WHO Director-General for a five-year term by WHO Member States at the Seventieth World Health Assembly in May 2017.

  

He is the first WHO Director-General to have been elected from multiple candidates by the World Health Assembly, and is the first person from the WHO African Region to serve as WHO’s chief technical and administrative officer.

  

Immediately after taking office on 1 July 2017 Dr Tedros outlined five key priorities for the Organization: universal health coverage; health emergencies; women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health; health impacts of climate and environmental change; and a transformed WHO.

  

Prior to his election as WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros served as Ethiopia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2012–2016. In this role he led efforts to negotiate the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, in which 193 countries committed to the financing necessary to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

  

Dr Tedros served as Ethiopia’s Minister of Health from 2005–2012, where he led a comprehensive reform of the country’s health system. All roads lead to universal health coverage for Dr Tedros, and he has demonstrated what it takes to expand access to health care with limited resources.

  

The transformation he led as Ethiopia’s Minister of Health improved access to health care for millions of people. Under his leadership Ethiopia invested in critical health infrastructure, expanded its health workforce, and developed innovative health financing mechanisms.

  

Beyond Ethiopia, Dr Tedros’ global leadership on malaria, HIV/AIDS, and maternal and child health has been immensely impactful. He was elected as Chair of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Board in 2009, and previously served as Chair of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership Board, and Co-chair of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Board. 

  

Born in the city of Asmara, Eritrea, Dr Tedros holds a Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) in Community Health from the University of Nottingham and a Master of Science (MSc) in Immunology of Infectious Diseases from the University of London. Dr Tedros is globally recognised as a health scholar, researcher, and diplomat with first-hand experience in research, operations, and leadership in emergency responses to epidemics.

  

Throughout his career Dr Tedros has published numerous articles in prominent scientific journals, and received awards and recognition from across the globe. He received the Decoration of the Order of Serbian Flag in 2016, and was awarded the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Humanitarian

Award in recognition of his contributions to the field of public health in 2011.

Muzoon Al-Mellehan
------------------

### Student, UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador 

Muzoon Almellehan, 19, is a Syrian refugee and education activist.

  

Muzoon has been campaigning for children’s education in emergencies since she was forced to flee Syria in 2013 with her family. Muzoon started her campaign in Jordan, where she was living as a refugee in camps for three years, including 18 months in Za’atari. As part of a UNICEF-supported back-to-school campaign, she first advocated for more girls to go to school in August 2013 and went from tent to tent speaking with parents of children who were at risk of child marriage or early labor. Over the next two and a half years she became synonymous with standing up for the rights of children, particularly girls, to stay in or go back to school. She accompanied Malala on two visits to the camp.

  

Muzoon is currently studying A-levels in Newcastle, United Kingdom, where she has been resettled with her family. She is the youngest UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador ever appointed and offers a powerful, credible, authentic voice on education in emergencies. She is also a No Lost Generation (NLG) campaign champion for UNICEF Middle East and North Africa.

  

In April 2017, she travelled to Chad with UNICEF to meet refugee children forced to flee unspeakable violence. During the six-day visit, Muzoon saw the impact of the Boko Haram insurgency on children’s education, reminding her of her own experiences four years ago when she was uprooted by the Syria conflict. She made a strong connection with the children she met including a 16-year-old girl who was abducted by Boko Haram outside her school in Nigeria at the age of 13 and was drugged, exploited and abused for three years before fleeing to Chad. Muzoon also met children who are able to get an education for the first time, and community members who, like her once, are taking huge risks to get children into school. On the last day of the mission, Muzoon delivered an emotional speech at a university in N’Djamena to an audience of 300 female university students.

  

Most recently Muzoon attended the G20 in Germany where she spoke at the Global Citizen concert and met with world leaders including Angela Merkel to ask them to protect every child’s right to an Education regardless of their background.

David Beasley
-------------

### Executive Director World Food Programme

In a public service and business career that spans more than four decades, David Beasley, a former governor of the US state of South Carolina, has worked across political, religious and ethnic lines to champion economic development, education, interfaith cooperation and humanitarian assistance for the most vulnerable – not just within the United States, but across the globe. 

  

For the past 10 years, Governor Beasley has worked with influential leaders and on-the-ground programme managers in more than 100 countries on projects to foster peace, reconciliation and economic progress. In Ethiopia, for example, he worked alongside Tony Hall, former U.S. Ambassador to FAO, IFAD and WFP, on a partnership with the Project Mercy charity to increase food access for students and internally displaced people. 

  

Governor Beasley has also helped strengthen cooperation and communication among the business, political and non-governmental sectors in regions of long-standing political, ethnic and religious tension, including South Sudan, Sudan, Tunisia and Yemen. Last year, for example, he and his team led an international conference in Kosovo that brought hundreds of business and political leaders from the Balkans together for five days of dialogue. 

  

As a governor, Beasley cast a vision of reform for the state of South Carolina. Governor Beasley was the first chief executive in South Carolina history to lead a Cabinet form of government, essentially building a new government with a revamped system of operation and management. Relying on teamwork and partnerships, the Beasley team’s creative approach included overhauling the state’s criminal justice system, the economy, the welfare system and the educational system, among others. His inaugural South Carolina cabinet flourished in an atmosphere of team spirit and cooperation.

  

One of Governor Beasley’s greatest accomplishments came in redesigning the state’s Commerce Department. When he became governor, traditional pillars of the economy – textiles, farming and military spending – were declining. Through setting measurable goals and focusing on specific growth industries, he transformed the economy into a healthy, diverse, and robust market based on steel, automotive, chemical, plastics, and pharmaceuticals goods and services. Within two years, South Carolina consistently had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, and the state increased its annual private sector capital investments from US $2 billion to over US$6 billion – fueled in large part by international investment from companies like BMW, Honda, Bridgestone and Firestone. 

  

In addition to public policy, Governor Beasley provided a steady hand in moments of crisis. His leadership before, during and after hurricanes enabled the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people along South Carolina’s coast, including high season tourist areas, schools, healthcare facilities, businesses and families. His leadership ensured access to food, healthcare and shelter for the most vulnerable households during and immediately after the natural disasters. 

  

Governor Beasley was also elected by his peers to be chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Prior to becoming Governor, Beasley served as Speaker Pro Tempore of the South Carolina House of Representatives, Democrat Majority Leader of the South Carolina House of Representatives, Chairman of the South Carolina House Education Committee, and Chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee on Education. Governor Beasley also served as Chairman of the U.S. Health and Human Services Agency’s National Rural Health Committee for 10 years. 

  

As a political figure, David Beasley has been routinely called upon to communicate effectively and transparently to the public. As Governor and chairman of multiple government committees, Beasley honed his diplomatic skills and has continued to put them to use after leaving public office. Just a few months after the attacks on September 11, 2001, Beasley led an international economic conference in Tunisia that united American and Western experts on trade policy, foreign direct investment and information technology with Tunisian officials and business leaders. Additionally, over the past 15 years, Governor Beasley has led conferences and missions in some of the most conflict-affected areas of the world, including Kosovo, South Sudan, Sudan, Tunisia and Yemen. 

  

Governor Beasley believes strongly that personal dialogue and relationships are critical to conflict resolution, and he has brought political and religious opponents together to forge peace and better relations. He travels to as many as 30 countries each year, bringing leaders of different nations and party affiliations together to encourage better dialogue and promote peace. Through his travels, Governor Beasley has developed close personal relationships with leaders in many nations, including heads of state and members of various national parliaments – a network that he will use to expand WFP’s support base. 

  

Governor Beasley was the first Governor in South Carolina to call for the removal of the Confederate Flag from the State Capitol, a stand that played a significant role in his unsuccessful re-election bid but earned him the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. At many points during his term, Governor Beasley led efforts to calm serious racial tensions while encouraging reconciliation and peace, and he established a Race Relations Commission to make progress on this issue. Governor Beasley brought women and members of minority groups into his cabinet and senior positions. Under his administration, South Carolina had a higher percentage of women in top leadership than any other state in the nation. 

  

Governor Beasley received his B.A. and J.D. from the University of South Carolina. He resides in South Carolina with the former Mary Wood Payne and is the father of four children.

Nikolaj Coster-Waldau
---------------------

### Actor UNDP Goodwill Ambassador

In his role as UNDP Goodwill Ambassador, Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known for starring in HBO’s Game of Thrones, is a passionate advocate for climate action and gender equality and the key role they play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Also known as the Global Goals, they are a universal call to action to end poverty, fight inequality and stop climate change.

  

“Like most parents, I want my daughters to achieve their dreams in life. But we cannot create opportunities and brighter futures for our children without protecting the planet we live on,” said the father of two girls.

  

Nikolaj is helping spread the important message that we cannot achieve the Global Goals without empowering women and safeguarding our environment and that each and every one of us needs to play an active part in creating a brighter tomorrow for all. Women have the power to change the world. That’s why fighting for gender equality and the empowerment of women is a key part of Coster-Waldau’s mission. But just as important to the actor is the critical need to take care of our planet in the process—because the effects of climate change are real and affect us all.

  

In addition to his award-winning acting career, Coster-Waldau is also a producer and screenwriter. After graduating from the Danish School of Theatre in Copenhagen, he received his first major film role in Nightwatch in 1994, a critical and commercial success in Denmark. He has since starred in various films in Europe and North America, including Shot Caller, Small Crimes, Gods of Egypt, The Other Woman and 1,000 Times Good Night.

Kiran has partnered with various menstrual health organizations to improve women’s access to affordable and safe menstrual care.
