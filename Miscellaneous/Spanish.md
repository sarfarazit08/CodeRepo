|él, ella / usted	|es	|he, she is / you (formal) are|

Some examples of ser being used to talk about **physical appearance, professions, origins, and marital status**.

Notice `y = and` in Spanish.

|Él es de Panamá.|He is from Panama.|
|María es casada y es abogada.|María is married and is a lawyer.|
|Nosotros somos americanos.|We are Americans.|
|Ellas son abogadas.|They are lawyers.|

### Whereabouts

Do you want to know where someone or something is from? Use ser!
To talk about where you or someone else is from, just follow this formula:

* ser conjugation + de + place

|Spanish| English|
|-|-|
|Yo soy de México.|I am from Mexico.|
|Celia es de España.|Celia is from Spain.|
|Elizabeth es de los Estados Unidos.|Elizabeth is from the United States.|
|Felipe es de Bogotá.|Felipe is from Bogotá.|
|Ella es de Madrid.|She is from Madrid.|

You can also ask someone where they are from by using the phrase ¿De dónde eres?, or Where are you from?

|Spanish| English|
|-|-|
|¿De dónde eres?|Where are you from?|
|Yo soy de México.|I'm from Mexico.|
|Nosotros somos de México.| We are from Mexico.|
|Ellos son empresarios.| They are entrepreneurs.|

### Professions

|Spanish| English|
|-|-|
|abogado    | lawyer |
|jubilado   | retiree|
|empresario | entrepreneur, businessman|
|maestro    | teacher|
|ama de casa| housewife|
|doctor     | doctor|
|estudiante | student|

**NOTE** : Even though `ama de casa` is a feminine word, it takes the masculine article `el` because it begins with a stressed `a- sound`. Also keep in mind that the masculine equivalent of `ama de casa` would be a `amo de casa`.

### Spanish vowels

**Las vocales**

Spanish and English have the same five vowels, but they can sound very different -  a, e, i, o, u. Keep in mind that, unlike in English, Spanish vowels are never silent.
So the rule of thumb for Spanish vowels is: If you see a vowel, you say a vowel.
