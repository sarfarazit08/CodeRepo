We recommend that you explore the Available Charts Types in Office (not all charts types are available in each version of Excel). For the quiz, you will need to review the section titled “Select a chart type to learn more about it”. From the dropdown box “What chart type are you interested in?” select the chart type you are interested in to learn more about that chart.
