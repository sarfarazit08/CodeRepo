### Further Reading

For more information about available chart types in Excel, please review these resources:

We recommend that you explore the Available Charts Types in Office (not all charts types are available in each version of Excel). For the quiz, you will need to review the section titled “Select a chart type to learn more about it”. From the dropdown box “What chart type are you interested in?” select the chart type you are interested in to learn more about that chart.

### Scenario

The company has just hired Lucy as its new Sales manager. You are tasked to introduce Lucy to the company, its product portfolio and its sales performance since 2011. To do this, you have asked Jack, the IT manager to prepare some data for you.
