    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Shortest path algorithms are widely used in transportation and scheduling\n",
    "+ Such algorithms focus on the most efficient route between a pair of nodes\n",
    "+ Edge weights determine the cost of a path in such algorithms\n",
    "+ If all edge weights are equal, use the **Unweighted Shortest Path Algorithm**\n",
    "+ IF edge weights are unequal, use **Dijkstra's Algorithm**\n",

    "\n",
    "+ Algorithm operates through a data structure called the **distance table.**\n",
    "+ It contains:\n",
    "    1. _Node_: Holds all the nodes of the graph\n",
    "    2. _Distance_: Holds the shortest distance from the source node\n",
    "    3. _Preceding Node_: Holds the preceding node in the shortest path from source node to that particular node\n",
    "+ Distance Table changes based on the source node selected to find shortest distance path\n",
    "+ Cost of shortest distance path = no. of hops between the nodes in question\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Buidling the Distance Table\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At outset, all we know is that source node is at distance = 0 from itself.\n",
    "2. Start at the source, initialize a queue of nodes (nodes that we've not visited so far)\n",
    "3. Add immediate neighbors of source node to the queue\n",
    "4. Update distance table for those immediate neighbors\n",
    "5. if you still have nodes in the queue to process, repeat this by dequeuing the first node from the left ones\n",
    "6. Add immediate neighbors to queue for the node left after dequeue\n",
    "7. Update distance table for those immediate neighbors\n",
    "8. Repeat steps 5, 6 and 7 until all the immediate neighbors covered (no processing is needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We use **Backtracking** on distance table to find out the **Shortest Distance Path**\n",
    "    + **Note**: To Trace the Shortest Path, backtrack from Destination Node to Source Node.\n",
    "+ Cost of shortest distance path = no. of hops between the nodes in question\n",
