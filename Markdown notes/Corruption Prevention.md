# Corruption Prevention

### What is Corruption?

* Think about what you currently know about corruption. Do you think all corruption is illegal? **No**

Many things that you might consider corrupt acts are illegal, but not all. While laws are not the only point of reference to define corruption, International frameworks can be a useful guide. The United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) is meant to increase corruption prevention, advocate for laws to criminalise corruption, increase international cooperation in fighting corruption, and more.

* Do you think that all corruption is unethical? **Yes**

Very good. Although what is considered ethical will be different from person to person, all corrupt acts - as abuses of entrusted power - are unethical.

* Do you think that participating in a corrupt act is ever justifiable? **No**

This is a difficult question. Our mandate as humanitarians is to alleviate suffering and sometimes, save lives. Some say they will do anything to meet this mandate, but participating in corruption has longer term impact beyond the immediate situation.

## Signs of corruption

### Conflicts of interest

* You are a human resources officer. The office has an immediate opening for a programme assistant. The Head of Security wants you to hire his nephew. He says there is no need to go through normal hiring processes because he will personally vouch for his nephew's knowledge and skills. You are asked to process the request. Do you process it?
	
	* Yes, I would. I don't think this is corruption.
	* Yes, I would, but I think this might be corruption.
	* No, I would not. I think this is a form of corruption. **Correct**

The Head of Security is annoyed, but encourages his nephew to apply. When checking references, you learn that the nephew had a record of stealing from previous employers. A more suitable person is hired for the position.

Someone else was hired after it is revealed that the nephew had stolen from employers in the past. Good job in not contributing to an act of corruption by processing the request.

Nice job. By following regular hiring procedures, you were able to determine that this person was unsuitable for the position before making the hire.

Hiring a family member becomes an act of corruption when regular hiring procedures are ignored.

In addition to potentially leading to security concerns such as in this case, not following the regular hiring procedures may also lead to hires who are not qualified to do their job and resentment by other employees.

* You are a finance officer. The niece of GARO's head of support services has just graduated with honors from university and wants to get work experience. There is a vacancy in the youth office that has not yet been approved and posted that fits her skills perfectly. The head of support services wants to hire her instead of posting the position. You are asked to process the request. Do you approve it?
	
	* Yes, I would. I do not think this is corruption.
	* Yes, I would but I think this might be corruption.
	* No, I would not do it. This is a form of corruption. **Correct**

The head of support services is annoyed that his niece is not directly hired. However, the organisation goes through its usual procedures and an existing employee is promoted into the position instead.

The position was posted and an existing employee was promoted into it. Good job in not contributing to an act of corruption by processing the request.

Nice work. Here you were able to avoid a negative impact on reputation and employee morale by following your usual procedures. While the niece might have done a good job, hiring a family member without following the appropriate hiring procedures is corruption regardless of who does it. It is important for an organisation to be transparent and accountable in all matters, including human resources matters.

* At lunch, you hear that your boss' son will have an unpaid internship in your office despite there being no vacancies for this post. You have met the son in the past, and you know he is a hard worker. But you know that other people have inquired about internships in the past and were told no internships were available. Do you report this to a manager?
	
	* No, I would not. The Director must know what he is doing.
	* Yes, I would. This sounds like nepotism. **Correct**

The boss' internship is postponed pending an investigation. The boss' son is not automatically given an internship but the vacancy for the internship is posted for all to apply.

Staff morale improves when the staff realize that they have a voice too in fighting corruption.

Nice job. Corruption does not need to have a financial component. Not reporting the corruption would have been giving something of value (work experience) to a person because of their family connections. Perceived conflicts of interest or potential favoritism can cause problems even when procedures are followed.
