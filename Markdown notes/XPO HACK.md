# AI ML Predictive Pricing

### The Rules
+ The hackathon will last for 12 hours from start to finish.
+ You are open to create a solution with technology of your choice
+ You can use a combination of open source/ proprietary software/ hardware to build solutions.
+ It is preferred to do solution development before event day so that teams can come prepared with a solution approach document to present during hackathon event.

###  What?
Provide XPO an ability to do predictive pricing and disrupt the market

### Why?
 Predictive models driven by historical transactions, external data such as weather/traffic, lane level patterns, will enable and set price for future demand and gain cost advantage by procuring carrier capacity in advance.
 This will enable XPO to predict lane and carrier pricing movements with greater accuracy and drive dynamic price changes that align to market shifts.
 The capability should also enable XPO to do pricing whatifs for contracted and noncontracted load and help achieve improvement in profitability and load uptick.
 The capability should enable XPO to respond to Customer RFPs/Bids through simulation of lane level price and profitability, driven by historical demand and price patterns.

### Who?
+ XPO Pricing and Sales Reps

###  How?
 Leverage a data warehouse or big data platform
 ML algorithms to understand pattern of data and past price points
	o Leverage lasso or elasticnet, available in R (glmnet package) or use random forest algorithm in R
 Visualization of forecasted pricing trends at a lane level – can use Power BI or Tableau
 Present a user console which will recommend Price for a lane and then let the user do what-ifs to check profitability shifts

### Data Requirements:
 2 – 3 years of order and rate data
 Demand forecast for 2 quarters if available
 Industry data on freight – ITS/DAT
 Weather related historical data and forecasts – if available
