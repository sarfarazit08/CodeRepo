### Outline 

+ 1.1 - What is Money? 
+ 1.2 - What is the Bitcoin? 
+ 1.3 - Why are Bitcoins Special? 
+ 1.4 - Who Controls the Bitcoin? 
+ 1.5 - Why are Bitcoins Worth Anything?
+ 1.6 - Some Great Introductions

### 1.1 - What is Money? 

+ The Neurosurgeon and the Baker Dilemma 
+ Money is usually defined in terms of three functions: 
    + Means of Exchange 
    + Store Value 
    + Unit of Account 
+ We tend to also to care about the following properties: 
    + Divisibility 
    + Durability 
    + Fungibility 
    + Verifiability
    
### 1.2 - Why is Money Worth Anything?

+ A group of people must agree to exchange goods and services for the money 
+ Some authority must validate and maintain the currency (usually a government) 
+ Currencies generally are backed by something such as attachment to a respected entity (US government) or some finite resource like gold 

### 1.3 - So What's the Problem With Regular Money? 

+ A small group of people decide how to regulate and manage the currency
+ Online exchange lacks any notion of privacy
+ You have to trust one nation at a time
+ You must have faith in entities like banks and paypal

### 1.4 - The Solution? Bitcoin 

Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.

+ Developed by an anonymous hacker under the pen name **Satoshi Nakamoto** in 2009.
+ Replaces the typical trusted middleman with a completely decentralized peer-to-peer system governed by open sourced algorithms 
The Bitcoin system is a collection of clients analogous to torrent clients downloading a file. Every Bitcoin client has a record of every single transaction and the amount of Bitcorns in each account 
+ Accounts are anonymous. They are just public key addresses without any personally identifiable information attached. 
+ When someone wishes to spend a Bitcoin, he uses a secret key associated with his account and simply enters the address he wants to send the Bitcoins to. The network verifies all transactions automatically. 

### 1.5 - Why Are Bitcoins Special? 

+ The currency has a maximum circulation of just under 21 million coins (reached in 2140) causing the value of each coin to increase over time 
+ Every transaction is verified by the entire Bitcoin network making it nearly impossible to counterfeit a Bitcoin 
+ While all transactions are know, like cash there is no identity explicitly attached to a transaction making the Bitcoin pseudo-anonymous 
+ Due to their decentralized nature, no one government can effectively regulate or control the Bitcoin. It would require the consent of the entire internet. 
+ Combines the scarcity of gold with the divisibility of digital currencies. A Bitcoin can be divided as small as 0.00000001. 
+ Transactions are permanent removing the notion of a chargeback 
+ Accounts can never be frozen by a government entity 
+ Sending Bitcoins to someone is as simple as sending an email 

### 1.6 - Who Controls the Bitcoin? 
+ Who controls a Internet/torrent?  (No one)
+ As a Peer-2-Peer system, the entire network have to agree on the rules before hand. Once this is done, it is nearly impossible to undo 
+ Thus, no one person or group can ever control the Bitcoin 

### 1.7 - Why are the Bitcoins Worth Anything?

+ Every currency is priced according to its supply and demand and what people are willing to exchange for it in terms of goods and services. 
+ Due to its non-affiliation with any government or corporation alongside the intrinsic privacy from the network's design, the Bitcoin has a minimum value. This value is the price the internet puts on anonymity and protection from inflation or manipulation. 
+ As more people use the Bitcoin for goods and services, it will increase In value because the supply cannot keep up with demand. This makes the Bitcoin Inherently deffationary.

### Outline

+ 2.1 - The Bitcoin Wallet 
+ 2.2 - Filling Your Wallet
+ 2.3 - Moving Bitcoins Between Wallets
+ 2.4 - Some Security Advice
+ 2.5 - Usefull Links

### 2.1 - The Bitcoin Wallet

+ Bitcoins are stored via methods in public key cryptography (Elliptic Curve DSA) 
+ There are two keys associated with each wallet:
    + Public Key (Everybody knows):  Your address for people to send money to, Ex: **19Gubir2n7e9JpW1Av7wrMd5M5AtTdzVwR**
    + Private Key (Known only by wallet’s owner):  A secret key only you can use that allows you to send money to other wallets

#### Types of Bitcoin Wallets

+ Desktop (Tied to a Computer)
    + Bitcoin-Qt
    + Electrum
    + Armory
+ Cell  Phone (Tied to your Cell Phone)
    + Bitcoin Wallet 
+ Cloud-Based (On the Internet like Gmail)
    + Blockchain
    + BIPS 
    + Coinbase
+ [Choose your wallet](http://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet)

### 2.2 - Filling Your Bitcoin Wallet

+ How do you fill a regular  wallet?
+ You have to acquire Bitcoins like you acquire regular money
+ Option A: Buy Them
    + Through an exchange like Mtgox
    + Through a website like Coinbase or BIPS
    + On Ebay as a physical coin minted by casacius  
+ Option B: Barter for Them 
    + Find someone with bitcoins and trade something for them 
+ Option C: Perform Services or Sell Goods for Them
    + Offer to do something for someone with bitcoins 
    + Use Bitpay to sell products for bitcoins
  
### 2.3 - Moving Bitcoins Between Wallets

+ I will move some coins between my Wallets
+ Remember that transactions are not reversible 
+ Also remember that it is possible to send Bitcoins to the wrong address be very careful about the sending address. Verify it is correct if you have to enter it manually 

### 2.4 - Some Security Advice

+ Treat your Bitcoin wallet as you would a bank account. Never let anyone have your private key or access to a computer that has the private key
+ If you have the knowledge, then I’d recommend encrypting your wallet
+ Backup your wallet in two separate places (ex: flash drive and also email it to yourself)
+ If you use a cloud based wallet, then understand the website operator may have access to your wallet. Only use cloud wallets from trusted sources

### 3.1 - The Metrics of  a Currency

### 3.1.1 - Distribution of Money

+ Ask four questions:
    + Where is the money geographically based?
    + Is the money evenly distributed or controlled by a few?
    + How does the money move through the economy?
    + How is new money added to the system?

### 3.1.2 - Bitcoin Distribution

+ The Bitcoin is geographically decentralized by design; however, has significant penetration in developed markets like the United States, Europe, Russia and Japan (>85%)
+ Early adopters still control a large chunk of the Bitcoins in circulation [1]. However, it is difficult to know how many Bitcoins one person has due to the anonymity of addresses. Over time Bitcoins have become more distributed 
+ We typically measure Bitcoin movement with a metric called Bitcoin Days Destroyed (discuss later)
+ New Bitcoins are added by Bitcoin mining (discuss in lecture 4)

### 3.1.3 - Supply and Demand for Money

+ This notion is usually measured by a complex set of signals divined from international trade and monetary exchanges
+ Generally speaking, a central authority will decide how much money to put into circulation and then either reduce or increase the money supply according to political factors and trade goals. Cheap money (think China) is good for exports while expensive money is good for imports. [2] 
+ There is an incredibly deep system of interconnected banks, regulatory agencies and treaties built to allow easy conversion of one money to another with the US Dollar usually serving as the unit of account for all other currencies (See the Bretton Woods Agreement)

### 3.1.4 - Bitcoin Supply and Demand 

+ The supply of the Bitcoin is well understood and cannot be manipulated by outside entities (limit 21 million)
+ Because the supply is fixed, the Bitcoin is intrinsically deflationary. Over time if the Bitcoin survives as a currency, it must gain value. 
+ There has never been a digital deflationary currency and thus economy theory has little to offer in determining the Bitcoin’s value relative to other currencies  
+ As more people use the Bitcoin (which is very likely to happen due to its anonymity and low transaction fees), demand will dramatically outpace supply 

### 3.1.5 - Money Exchanges

+ We generally call the money exchanges Forex exchanges 
+ They are cumulatively the largest exchanges in the world totally in the trillions of dollars per day 
+ Forex is unique in that nation states also participate in the markets to some degree. Generally countries do not take a position in the equity and security markets outside sovereign debt. But the value of a nation’s money has dramatic effects on its economy [3] 
+ There are a massive set of complex financial instruments built to manage risk in the Forex markets. [4]

### 3.1.6 - Bitcoin Exchanges

+ The Bitcoin is only four years old, yet has reached over a billion dollars in market capitalization
+ There are several exchanges for the Bitcoin; however, the largest is **Mtgox**.
+ Venture capital has begun investing millions of dollars into developing new exchanges and new financial products to better serve the needs of both Bitcoin speculators and merchants 
+ Currently the US Dollar is tied closest to the Bitcoin. Check [here](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/volumepie/)

### 3.1.7 - Relationship to Other Currencies 

+ Exchanges price money according to other money; however, there may be other factors influencing a particular currency 
+ Certain currencies are closely correlated due to political issues or geography 
+ For example, there is a strong connection between the US Dollar and the Euro. 
+ This topic is studied by both professional traders and economists. Traders seek to exploit patterns and trends for financial gain whereas economists seek to discover how economies tend to become interconnected due to trade and then predict future growth or contraction  

### 3.1.8 - Bitcoin’s Relationship to Other Currencies

+ The Bitcoin is currently most closely tied to the US Dollar. Events that tend to strengthen the Dollar tend to weaken the Bitcoin
+ The most interesting pattern seen is that if a central bank or government takes actions deemed harmful by the holders of its currency, then the Bitcoin tends to rise significantly [5]. Gold has traditionally taken this role 
+ The Bitcoin seems to be a combination of a gold backed currency with the ability to arbitrarily divide and no political pressure to behave in a certain fashion. Thus, we do not have models to understand its pricing in relation to other currencies as of 2013

### 3.1.9 - Oligarchiness

+ All currencies are connected to certain groups and in some cases individuals whom yield considerable influence over the factors like value, supply and data transparency 
+ In the United States, the federal reserve combined with several of the largest banks have an enormous amount of influence over the money supply and the price of the US Dollar. Therefore, those who speculate the price of the dollar tend to closely watch the decisions of the fed and major financial institutions 
+ The term Oligarchiness is used to describe the level of independence the money has from manipulation by a single entity. Most national currencies are controlled to some extent by a central bank, which controls the supply of the currency. 
+ Low Oligarchiness currencies are resistant to manipulation and are usually backed by gold or some other finite commodity whereas high Oligarchiness currencies  are generally fiat and are subject to manipulation (think Renminbi)

### 3.1.10 - Bitcoin’s Oligarchiness

+ Current the Bitcoin is greatly influenced by the actions of a few therefore it is a high Oligarchiness currency
+ The open source group controlling the generally accepted Bitcoin mining software alongside the mining pool operators and the leadership of Mtgox constitute a significant influence over both the price and legitimacy of the currency
+ Over time this influence has considerably decayed as the Bitcoin has become more global
+ As more entities enter the Bitcoin ecosystem, the level of Oligarchiness will decrease until the Bitcoin becomes relatively immune to manipulation or control by any one entity. If the Bitcoin survives for another 4 years with its current growth curve, then the Bitcoin will not be controllable even by nation states
+ We will discuss the 51% problem in the mining lecture
+ As an interesting footnote, those who have the greatest influence over the Bitcoin currently have a financial incentive for the Bitcoin to both survive and appreciate in value  

### 3.2 - Bitcoin Specific Metrics

### 3.2.1 - Mining Pool Hash rate and Work Distribution 

+ Determines how fast new Bitcoins enter the economy. 
+ The algorithms enforced by the mining clients attempt to limit this to currently 25 coins per 10 minutes

### 3.2.2 - Regulation 

+ FINCEN says we are ok [6][7][8]

### 3.2.3 - Bitcoin Days Destroyed

+ This metric was invented because not every Bitcoin transaction record is for an actual good or service. For example, I transferred money between my cloud wallet and my desktop wallet in the prior lecture, but obviously this had no impact on the economy.
+ Instead we measure how long it has been since the coins in question have  been spent. Thus to calculate Bitcoin days destroyed take each Bitcoin transaction and multiply it by the amount of time since it was last spent in day. 
+ Example: I received 10 Bitcoins five days ago and then bought a laptop today for them. Thus we have 5 * 10 = 50 Bitcoin Days Destroyed [9]

### 3.2.4 - Blockchain 

+ The ledger used to keep track of all commerce with Bitcoins since the very beginning [10]

# 4 - Bitcoin Mining 

### Outline

+ 4.1 - Why Mining is Necessary 
+ 4.2 - A Block 
+ 4.3 - The Blockchain 
+ 4.4 - Mining Hardware 
+ 4.5 - Mining Pools 
+ 4.6 - How to Setup a Mining Client  
+ 4.7 - The Future of Mining

### 4.1 - Why Mining is Necessary

+ Bitcoin lacks a central issuing authority to both create new money and serve as a verifier of transactions 

#### How Does Mining Create New Money and Also Verify Transactions?

+ This issue was resolved by Satoshi Nakamoto in his foundational paper [1] 
+ He proposed that one would take a queue of transactions over a finite time period (approx. 10 minutes) and then create a math problem that takes roughly 10 minutes to solve. The first computer to resolve the problem receives an award of Bitcoins
+ This process is called mining and the set of transactions to verify alongside the proof of work problem are called a Block

### 4.2 - A Block

+ This is what is contained within a block [2]: 

<img src="" alt="table" /> 

+ With this information, the goal of the miners in the network is to generate a hash under a certain value which is determined by a number called the difficulty
+ It is like a lottery system that is winner takes all. The difficulty is like the set of numbers you have to hit to get an award of Bitcoins and the amount of tickets you can buy per second is your hash rate (generally measured in Megahashes per second)
+ The first person to produce a hash that satisfies the difficulty rate (get the right numbers) wins all the coins associated with the block. Blocks used to be 50 coins and are now 25 coins. Every 4 years the block award is cut in half. 

### 4.3 - The Blockchain

+ The first block was created by Satoshi and is called the genesis block [3]
+ Every other block is connected to this block and the entire set of all blocks since the genesis block is called the Blockchain [4]
+ Think of the Blockchain as the ledger that keeps track of every single transaction ever made with Bitcoins
+ The Blockchain’s size and complexity prevent anyone from attempting to counterfeit transactions of Bitcoins. An attacker would need to have 51% of the computing power of the Bitcoin network to be able to modify the Blockchain [5] [6] 

### 4.4 - Mining Hardware

+ When the Bitcoin was first created, we could mine with regular Intel and AMD computer processors
+ Now Bitcoin mining is done with graphics cards. The most popular are AMD Radeon cards [7]
+ As of 2013, we have started to witness specialized hardware called FGPAs and ASICs that have massive performance over even GPUs 
+ Mining is only profitable when one can recoup both the initial hardware cost and the power spent making Bitcoins [8]

### 4.5 - Mining Pools

+ The block awards are not divided and there is no concept of most work done. Like a real lottery, close doesn’t count for the jackpot and it is winner takes all
+ Thus, mining pools were developed to combine the work of thousands of computers in exchange for a division of the profits if the pool receives a block of coins
+ Pool operators usually take a cut for running the pool and distribute the awards equally in accordance with the clients who did the most work
+ Here is a list of common Pools [9]
+ **[WARNING]** The pool operator is in no way obliged to give anyone their fair share of Bitcoins. Only trust operators who have been in business for some time and the community trusts

### 4.6 - How to Setup a Mining Client

+ I would recommend the GuiMiner software for new miners [10]
+ Only mine if you have an AMD graphics card and check the hardware list to get an idea of what your mining rate will be
+ GuiMiner does not need to be installed, but it does need to be connected to a Pool. As of 2013, I personally use Slush’s Pool [11]

### 4.7 - The Future of Mining

+ Over time, mining will become the domain of large entities with highly specialized equipment and well developed skills
+ Mining is only profitable if the Bitcoin continues to increase in value. Miners are very receptive to the price of the Bitcoin
+ It is a good crowd-signal that millions of dollars have been invested in new hardware to mine Bitcoins
+ Regardless of the block award, as long as transactions are done in Bitcoins, miners will receive Bitcoins from verification fees

### Outline

+ 5.1 - The Price of the Bitcoin
+ 5.2 - Some Statistics to Watch
+ 5.3 - Causes of Volatility
+ 5.4 - Financial Products
+ 5.5 - Some Risks to Consider 
+ 5.6 - Useful links


### 5.1 - The Price of the Bitcoin

+ Check Mtgox [1]
+ Check Blockchain’s Price Summary [2]

### 5.2 - Some Statistics to Watch

+ Bitcoin Watch [3]
+ Blockchain’s Charts [4]
+ BitcoinCharts.com [5]

### 5.3 - Causes of Volatility 

+ Markets are general discussed in terms of the amount of market actors and the amount of total wealth invested. 
+ Markets that are small in terms of actors and wealth are usually called thin markets. Markets like Oil and Gold are by contrast very thick. It is difficult to significantly influence or move thick markets in any one trading day [6]
+ Because the Bitcoin is currently a thin market, large accounts holding lots of Bitcoins can cause rapid price swings based upon their investment decisions
+ Bitcoins are still relatively illiquid. It can take some time to divest a position in Bitcoins  
+ We also lack financial products such as options to manage risk and build more sophisticated trading strategies 

### 5.4 - Financial Products

+ These products are usually called derivatives as their price is based upon an underlying asset. For example, an oil option is based upon an oil contract on a futures exchange
+ Derivatives allow traders to manage risk and establish price floors
+ Options for example can let you fix a price to either buy or sell an asset for a period of time. [7]
+ Generally speaking, the presence of well built and regulated derivatives significantly reduces the daily volatility of the underlying asset 

### 5.5 - Some Risks to Consider 

+ As will all investments, only invest money you can afford to lose. Do not gamble your future on any one investment
+ The Bitcoin has yet to be regulated by any sovereign entity. Regulations will come and we do not yet understand how they will impact the price of the Bitcoin
+ Once wall street decides to involve itself in the Bitcoin, you will be competing against seasoned professionals with decades of experience in the currency markets and billions of dollars to spend. 
+ Due to the thinness of the market, if an early adopted decides to leave the market, then he could collapse the price by triggering a panic sell
