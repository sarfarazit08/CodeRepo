### 1.1 - What is Money? 

+ The Neurosurgeon and the Baker Dilemma 
+ Money is usually defined in terms of three functions: 
    + Means of Exchange 
    + Store Value 
    + Unit of Account 
+ We tend to also to care about the following properties: 
    + Divisibility 
    + Durability 
    + Fungibility 
    + Verifiability
    
#### Why is Money Worth Anything?

+ A group of people must agree to exchange goods and services for the money 
+ Some authority must validate and maintain the currency (usually a government) 
+ Currencies generally are backed by something such as attachment to a respected entity (US government) or some finite resource like gold 

#### So What's the Problem With Regular Money? 

+ A small group of people decide how to regulate and manage the currency
+ Online exchange lacks any notion of privacy
+ You have to trust one nation at a time
+ You must have faith in entities like banks and paypal

#### The Solution? Bitcoin 

+ Developed by an anonymous hacker under the pen name **Satoshi Nakamoto** in 2009.
+ Replaces the typical trusted middleman with a completely decentralized peer-to-peer system governed by open sourced algorithms 
The Bitcoin system is a collection of clients analogous to torrent clients downloading a file. Every Bitcoin client has a record of every single transaction and the amount of Bitcorns in each account 
+ Accounts are anonymous. They are just public key addresses without any personally identifiable information attached. 
+ When someone wishes to spend a Bitcoin, he uses a secret key associated with his account and simply enters the address he wants to send the Bitcoins to. The network verifies all transactions automatically. 

#### Why Are Bitcoins Special? 
+ The currency has a maximum circulation of just under 21 million coins (reached in 2140) causing the value of each coin to increase over time 
+ Every transaction is verified by the entire Bitcoin network making it nearly impossible to counterfeit a Bitcoin 
+ While all transactions are know, like cash there is no identity explicitly attached to a transaction making the Bitcoin pseudo-anonymous 
+ Due to their decentralized nature, no one government can effectively regulate or control the Bitcoin. It would require the consent of the entire internet. 
+ Combines the scarcity of gold with the divisibility of digital currencies. A Bitcoin can be divided as small as 0.00000001. 
+ Transactions are permanent removing the notion of a chargeback 
+ Accounts can never be frozen by a government entity 
+ Sending Bitcoins to someone is as simple as sending an email 

#### Who Controls the Bitcoin? 
+ Who controls a Internet/torrent?  (No one)
+ As a Peer-2-Peer system, the entire network have to agree on the rules before hand. Once this is done, it is nearly impossible to undo 
+ Thus, no one person or group can ever control the Bitcoin 

#### Why are the Bitcoins Worth Anything?
