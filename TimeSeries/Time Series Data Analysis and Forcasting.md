# Time Series Data Analysis and Forecasting 

### Approach

1. Time Series Data
	+ Data Dictionary
	+ Date formative 
	+ not rigid valid but variables 
	+ column selection to make data frames
	+ user inputs if required
		+ frequency {drop down list, predict from data}
		+ start, end date (manual entry, variable based)
		+ header manipulation etc.	
	
2. Time Series Data Analysis
	+ user selection based model
	+ Auto forecast -> auto ARIMA model 
	+ build a basic model  
	+ collaborate forecast
	+ share forecast
	+ Data Hierarchy (group forecasting) (relations among category and brand)
		+ Bottom up approach 
		+ Top down approach 

3. Automation through a web portal
	
### R Packages

+ lubridate(multiple date)
+ forcast
+ hts (hierarchical time series)
