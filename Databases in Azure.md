# Databases in Azure

### Module 1 – Deploying Databases
Microsoft Azure provides multiple services that you can use to store, manage, and analyze data. The service that you use depends on an application's specific data-management requirements. It is important that you consider those requirements when choosing a data-management solution. In this module, you will:
*   Learn about the relational and non-relational database services in Microsoft Azure.
*   Learn how to choose between Azure SQL Database and SQL Server.
*   Learn about the basic architecture of Azure SQL Database.
*   Learn how to plan for the deployment of an Azure SQL Database.
*   Learn how to provision Azure SQL Database.

### Module 2 – Managing Databases
Organizations that use Azure SQL Database can avoid the cost and complexity of managing on-site SQL Server installations, and quickly set up and start using database applications. There are a variety of tools you can use to implement, secure and manage Azure SQL Database. It is also of primary importance that you can maintain business continuity which usually involves backing up data on a regular basis and providing some level of redundancy in the event of a failure. In this module, you will:
*   Learn how to configure firewall rules.
*   Learn how to manage logins and users.
*   Learn how to manage roles and permissions.
*   Learn how to copy and export an Azure SQL Database
*   Learn how to perform a restore of an Azure SQL Database.
*   Learn how to configure and manage geo-replication of Azure SQL Database.

### Module 3 – Monitoring Databases
While Azure SQL Database requires less ongoing maintenance than a SQL Server instance, you should still monitor your databases to help determine usage requirements, plan upgrades, and troubleshoot performance and security issues. In this module, you will:
*   Learn about dynamic management views to monitor Azure SQL Database.
*   Learn how to configure auditing for Azure SQL Database.
*   Learn how to monitor Azure SQL Database metrics and configure alerts.

### Module 4 – Introduction to Azure SQL Data Warehouse
Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a fully managed and scalable cloud service, that is compatible with other Azure offerings, such as Machine Learning and Data Factory, as well as existing SQL Server tools. As a distributed database management system that can handle large amounts of data in which analytics play a significant role, Azure SQL Data Warehouse provides an ideal solution for organizations that work with Big Data and need to scale up and down quickly. This module provides a very introductory look at Azure SQL Data Warehouse. In this module, you will:

*   Learn how Azure SQL Data Warehouse operates as a Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) system.
*   Learn about the function of Data Warehousing Units (DWU).
*   Learn about various methods of loading data into Azure SQL Database, including PolyBase.
*   Learn how to provision an Azure SQL Data Warehouse and enable connectivity with a firewall rule.
*   Learn about techniques for working with data in Azure SQL Data Warehouse, including SQL Server Management Studio and Visual Studio for creating data visualizations in Power BI.
