    > > Innovation is one of the foundations of Entrepreneurship.

#### Playing to your distinctive strength

> We tend to undervalue what we are and overvalue what we aren't. **- Malcolm Forbes**

> Our strengths clamor for our attention in the most basic way: using them makes you feel strong...you feel invigorated, inquisitive, successful. **- Marcus Buckingham**

Finding your strength (What makes you feel strong?)

  * What do you think about when there's nothing you've to think about?
  * What do others identify as your best skills?
  * Do you've confluence (a set) of skills?  
    > It may be tough to claim to be one of the world's best PHP programmers, Unix Gurus, or apparel e-commerce experts. But there may not be many excellent PHP programmers who are also Unix Gurus and apparel e-commerce domain experts. For the right customer, this is a distinctive strength. **- Ed Weismann Programmer**

## Setting Prices
 
#### Considerations for setting Prices
 
* Ask your customers what they pay for a similar product or service?
* Do they buy online or in store?
* A' La carte or All in one?
* B2B or B2C, Outside approval?
 
**Benchmark against competitors **

* If your product is better, charge more.
* If your product has fewer features, charge less.

* Err on side of pricing too high
* Experiment with prices (A/B Test, e.g., Amazon pricing)
* If your product = `$ 100` of value then charge `$ 30` - `$ 40`.
* Payments promote satisfaction (subscription model)
* Consider what you need to charge to make more money.
* Pricing shapes customer perception - it is a cue to customer about product value.

#### Deciding between Online Vs. Brick & Mortar

**Start online if at all possible:** 

* Startup and overhead costs are significantly lower.
* Think of your online presence as your minimum viable product.

**Deciding on Brick & Mortar:** A store, office, or other physical space customers can walk into during business hours.

1. Choose a specialty, offering exclusive items
2. Curate your inventory
3. Place emphasis on non-commoditized items, providing additional value
4. Have a great website, online presence 
5. Emphasize exclusivity 
6. Higher superb customer facing employees - enthusiastic and knowledgeable

#### Building a Financial Model

1. Revenue: `Price * Volume`, It should be data driven or some realistic, quantitative and logical.
2. Calculate your costs 
    * Cost to make and market your product
    * Employees
    * Office Space
    * Cost of acquiring customers
3. Solve for profit / loss (Being patient for growth, impatient for profit!)
    * Sell more at lower price?
    * Less at higher price?
    * Lower costs?
4. Know your burn rate
    * Know your runaway: how long you've to run your business until you need to shut down or innovate.

Keep a financial model to run your business as it's said follow the money/know your numbers to have a clear idea of your business.  
> Remember! for an entrepreneur cash really is kin.

#### Deciding on a Legal Structure

How profitable? how protected? how readily you can raise capital? - all these depends on your legal structure of the business.

**Five basic legal structures: **

1. Sole proprietorship: Where one person legally makes up the whole company.
    * No setup costs
    * Complete control
    * Tax efficient
    * Pass-through taxation
    e.g., Landscaping, computer support, day-care, contractors etc.
2. Limited liability company (LLC): Where one person legally makes up the whole company.
    * Limited liability, personal assets are protected
    * Creditors can't come after your house
    * Pass-through taxation
    * Issue stock to raise capitals
3. Partnership: partnership between two or more person/entities 
    * Less expensive than an LLC
    * Pass-through taxation
    * Partners are responsible for business obligations and debts
4. Subchapter S (S Corp): 
    * Provides limited liability 
    * Pass-through taxation
    * Tax rate is lower than LLC
    * Only wages are subject to tax
    * If a shareholder sells, the S Corp doesn't dissolve
    * More legal obligations
5. Sub-Chapter C (C Corp):
    * Structured to raise venture capital or for an Initial Public Offering (IPO)
    * Independent entity separate from the owners 
    * No personal assets at risk
    * Double taxation

> Avoid mixing business and personal accounts

> Consult with an `Accountant` and a `Lawyer` to understand the financial & legal obligations and maintain the business licenses and approvals properly.

## Intellectual Property (IP)

1. Trade Secrets: Confidential information that gives a business its competitive edge. E.g., 
    * Business Plans
    * Customer Lists
    * Pricing Designs 
    * Procedures

**Non-disclosure Agreement(NDA): ** An agreement between two parties that creates a confidential relationship, protecting proprietary information or trade secrets.

4. Patent: Set of exclusive rights granted to an inventor in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention.

> Patent Trade Offices (PTO): File a provisional patent application before filing the formal patent application. 

5. Right of Publicity: The right of an individual to keep one's image and likeness from being commercially exploited without permission or contractual compensation.

#### Gearing up operationally

Prepare operational checklist for your plan.

* What are the processes and procedures you'll use to produce your product or provided your service?
* What inputs do you need, whether physical goods or information?
* How will you source those materials?

* What are your delivery channels?
* Will you deliver the products yourself or will you outsource?
* If your delivering a service, or information, how quickly will that delivery happen?

* How do you need to operate your business so that they actually do prefer you?
* What are your expectations around service?

> Remember to FOCUS not only on the WHY but the HOW.

> MARKETING is what we say we are. OPERATIONS is about making our MARKETING true!

#### Bootstrapping your business

* What if you are short on money?
* What if you are short on time?
* What if you lack expertise?

> Dare, Dream, Do: Remarkable things happen when you dare to dream. **- Whitney Johnson**

## Building a TEAM

### Deciding a co-founder

#### Going SOLO

* Have enough of what you need
* Want to retain 100% of the equity and decision making
* Like to work alone

#### Deciding factors

1. Look at the relationship of the co-founders (if they've worked together previously etc., and built trust over time)
2. Think carefully about the respective roles
3. Think about how to divide the spoils
    * Dynamic Equity Split: Dividing equity based on phase weighting.
        * Vesting Equity: Distributed equity which requires founders to earn stakes based on time and milestones
4. Consider hiring a lawyer to protect your interest

> NOTE: Trust building among co-founders is of paramount importance.

> NOTE: Working with co-founders is similar to marriage. Even at times it could be more difficult to dissolve a business partnership than dissolving a marriage.

### Hiring the right people

2. _Team Diagnostic Tools_: Use these tools to analyze your team ability.
   * Team ability

3. Try before you buy - Hire for expertise, not credentials.

> "The 'experienced' candidate might have a resume which, on paper, gives you a lot of confidence, but you've to be open to the possibility that it might be the candidate with less experience, or with an unconventional background, who is the right person for the role." **-Francis Pedraza (CEO, Founder of Everest) **

4. Think of your employees as _assets_ and not _cost centers_.

> "Few things can help an individual more than to place responsibility on him, and to let him know that you trust him." **-Booker T. Washington**

2. Be aware of your personal bias. 
3. Only bring on people you trust.
4. Find people who love your company, who can advocate for your company
